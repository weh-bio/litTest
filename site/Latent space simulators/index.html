        <tr id="Small integration time steps limit molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to millisecond time scales. Markov state models (MSMs) and equation-free approaches learn low-dimensional kinetic models from MD simulation data by performing configurational or dynamical coarse-graining of the state space. The learned kinetic models enable the efficient generation of dynamical trajectories over vastly longer time scales than are accessible by MD, but the discretization of configurational space and/or absence of a means to reconstruct molecular configurations precludes the generation of continuous atomistic molecular trajectories. We propose latent space simulators (LSS) to learn kinetic models for continuous atomistic simulation trajectories by training three deep learning networks to (i) learn the slow collective variables of the molecular system, (ii) propagate the system dynamics within this slow latent space, and (iii) generatively reconstruct molecular configurations. We demonstrate the approach in an application to Trp-cage miniprotein to produce novel ultra-long synthetic folding trajectories that accurately reproduce atomistic molecular structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics at six orders of magnitude lower cost than MD. The dramatically lower cost of trajectory generation enables greatly improved sampling and greatly reduced statistical uncertainties in estimated thermodynamic averages and kinetic rates.">

        <tr id="Numerical approximation methods for the Koopman operator have advanced considerably in the last few years. In particular, data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)51 and its generalization, the extended-DMD (EDMD), are becoming increasingly popular in practical applications. The EDMD improves upon the classical DMD by the inclusion of a flexible choice of dictionary of observables which spans a finite dimensional subspace on which the Koopman operator can be approximated. This enhances the accuracy of the solution reconstruction and broadens the applicability of the Koopman formalism. Although the convergence of the EDMD has been established, applying the method in practice requires a careful choice of the observables to improve convergence with just a finite number of terms. This is especially difficult for high dimensional and highly nonlinear systems. In this paper, we employ ideas from machine learning to improve upon the EDMD method. We develop an iterative approximation algorithm which couples the EDMD with a trainable dictionary represented by an artificial neural network. Using the Duffing oscillator and the Kuramoto Sivashinsky partical differential equation as examples, we show that our algorithm can effectively and efficiently adapt the trainable dictionary to the problem at hand to achieve good reconstruction accuracy without the need to choose a fixed dictionary a priori. Furthermore, to obtain a given accuracy, we require fewer dictionary terms than EDMD with fixed dictionaries. This alleviates an important shortcoming of the EDMD algorithm and enhances the applicability of the Koopman framework to practical problems.">

        <tr id="The success of enhanced sampling molecular simulations that accelerate along collective variables (CVs) is predicated on the availability of variables coincident with the slow collective motions governing the long-time conformational dynamics of a system. It is challenging to intuit these slow CVs for all but the simplest molecular systems, and their data-driven discovery directly from molecular simulation trajectories has been a central focus of the molecular simulation community to both unveil the important physical mechanisms and drive enhanced sampling. In this work, we introduce state-free reversible VAMPnets (SRV) as a deep learning architecture that learns nonlinear CV approximants to the leading slow eigenfunctions of the spectral decomposition of the transfer operator that evolves equilibrium-scaled probability distributions through time. Orthogonality of the learned CVs is naturally imposed within network training without added regularization. The CVs are inherently explicit and differentiable functions of the input coordinates making them well-suited to use in enhanced sampling calculations. We demonstrate the utility of SRVs in capturing parsimonious nonlinear representations of complex system dynamics in applications to 1D and 2D toy systems where the true eigenfunctions are exactly calculable and to molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide and the WW domain protein.">

        <tr id="We investigate learning the eigenfunctions of evolution operators for time-reversal invariant stochastic processes, a prime example being the Langevin equation used in molecular dynamics. Many physical or chemical processes described by this equation involve transitions between metastable states separated by high potential barriers that can hardly be crossed during a simulation. To overcome this bottleneck, data are collected via biased simulations that explore the state space more rapidly. We propose a framework for learning from biased simulations rooted in the infinitesimal generator of the process and the associated resolvent operator. We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Importantly, we show that even with datasets containing only a few relevant transitions due to sub-optimal biasing, our approach recovers relevant information about the transition mechanism.">

        <tr id="Markov state models (MSMs) have proven valuable in studying the dynamics of protein conformational changes via statistical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. In MSMs, the complex configuration space is coarse-grained into conformational states, with dynamics modeled by a series of Markovian transitions among these states at discrete lag times. Constructing the Markovian model at a specific lag time necessitates defining states that circumvent significant internal energy barriers, enabling internal dynamics relaxation within the lag time. This process effectively coarse-grains time and space, integrating out rapid motions within metastable states. Thus, MSMs possess a multiresolution nature, where the granularity of states can be adjusted according to the time-resolution, offering flexibility in capturing system dynamics. This work introduces a continuous embedding approach for molecular conformations using the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), a framework that unifies dimensionality reduction and state space partitioning via a continuous, machine learned basis set. Without explicit optimization of the VAMP-based scores, SPIB demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying slow dynamical processes and constructing predictive multiresolution Markovian models. Through applications to well-validated mini-proteins, SPIB showcases unique advantages compared to competing methods. It autonomously and self-consistently adjusts the number of metastable states based on a specified minimal time resolution, eliminating the need for manual tuning. While maintaining efficacy in dynamical properties, SPIB excels in accurately distinguishing metastable states and capturing numerous well-populated macrostates. This contrasts with existing VAMP-based methods, which often emphasize slow dynamics at the expense of incorporating numerous sparsely populated states. Furthermore, SPIB's ability to learn a low-dimensional continuous embedding of the underlying MSMs enhances the interpretation of dynamic pathways. With these benefits, we propose SPIB as an easy-to-implement methodology for end-to-end MSM construction.">

The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge.

Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.">

More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

Many modern systems are too complicated to analyze directly or we do not have access to models, driving significant interest in learning methods. Koopman operators have emerged as a dominant approach because they allow the study of nonlinear dynamics using linear techniques by solving an infinite-dimensional spectral problem. However, current algorithms face challenges such as lack of convergence, hindering practical progress. This paper addresses a fundamental open question: \textit{When can we robustly learn the spectral properties of Koopman operators from trajectory data of dynamical systems, and when can we not?} Understanding these boundaries is crucial for analysis, applications, and designing algorithms. We establish a foundational approach that combines computational analysis and ergodic theory, revealing the first fundamental barriers -- universal for any algorithm -- associated with system geometry and complexity, regardless of data quality and quantity. For instance, we demonstrate well-behaved smooth dynamical systems on tori where non-trivial eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator cannot be determined by any sequence of (even randomized) algorithms, even with unlimited training data. Additionally, we identify when learning is possible and introduce optimal algorithms with verification that overcome issues in standard methods. These results pave the way for a sharp classification theory of data-driven dynamical systems based on how many limits are needed to solve a problem. These limits characterize all previous methods, presenting a unified view. Our framework systematically determines when and how Koopman spectral properties can be learned.">

That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight.

Instead, it calculates the relative path probability density at the time resolution of the MD integrator. Efficient implementation of Girsanov reweighting requires that the reweighting factors are calculated on-the-fly during the simulations and thus needs to be implemented within the MD integrator.

Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs.

To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="Proteins are inherently dynamic, and their conformational ensembles are functionally important in biology. Large-scale motions may govern protein structure–function relationship, and numerous transient but stable conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can play a crucial role in biological function. Investigating conformational ensembles to understand regulations and disease-related aggregations of IDPs is challenging both experimentally and computationally. In this paper first an unsupervised deep learning-based model, termed Internal Coordinate Net (ICoN), is developed that learns the physical principles of conformational changes from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Second, interpolating data points in the learned latent space are selected that rapidly identify novel synthetic conformations with sophisticated and large-scale sidechains and backbone arrangements. Third, with the highly dynamic amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ42) monomer, our deep learning model provided a comprehensive sampling of Aβ42’s conformational landscape. Analysis of these synthetic conformations revealed conformational clusters that can be used to rationalize experimental findings. Additionally, the method can identify novel conformations with important interactions in atomistic details that are not included in the training data. New synthetic conformations showed distinct sidechain rearrangements that are probed by our EPR and amino acid substitution studies. The proposed approach is highly transferable and can be used for any available data for training. The work also demonstrated the ability for deep learning to utilize learned natural atomistic motions in protein conformation sampling.">

        <tr id="Molecular dynamics simulations have become essential in many areas of atomistic modelling from drug discovery to materials science. They provide critical atomic-level insights into key dynamical events experiments cannot easily capture. However, their impact often falls short as the timescales of the important processes are inaccessible using standard molecular dynamics. Enhanced sampling methods provided avenues to access such crucial rare events, for example key slow conformational changes of biomolecules. However, the bias in enhanced sampling simulations is rarely optimized, and even if they are, the optimization criteria is based on the thermodynamics or Hamiltonian of the system, but do not directly consider molecular kinetics. Here, we introduce a novel enhanced sampling algorithm that adaptively optimizes the bias based on the kinetics of the system for the first time. We identify the optimal bias that minimizes a key physical observable, the mean first passage time (MFPT) from a starting state to a target state. Our algorithm makes use of the relation between biased and unbiased kinetics obtained from discretized Markov state models (MSMs), as established in the dynamic histogram analysis method (DHAM). We demonstrate the applicability of the method for different 1D and 2D analytical potential-based model examples, NaCl dissociation in explicit water, and phosphate unbinding in Ras GTPase. Our algorithm has excellent performance compared with state-of-art enhanced sampling methods in terms of the timescales required to reach the final state in the benchmarking systems. Our findings provide a novel, kinetics-driven enhanced sampling strategy, signatured by a targeted approach to facilitate mapping rare events, with the potential for breakthrough applications in drug discovery and materials science.">

The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system.

This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages.

In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.">

        <tr id="Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.">

In this study, we demonstrate that the transformer, a machine learning model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to predict the dynamical state-to-state transition kinetics of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories as input, we show that a transformer can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables this generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) to predict kinetically accurate sequences of future states for a diverse set of models and biomolecules of varying complexity. Remarkably, the GPT can predict future states much faster than traditional MD simulations. We show that it is particularly adept at forecasting the time evolution of an out-of-equilibrium active system that do not maintain detailed balance. An analysis of self-attention mechanism inherent in transformers is found to hold crucial role for capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Together, our results highlight the ability of transformer based machine learning model in generating future states of physicochemical systems with statistical precision.">

        <tr id="We present a differentiable formalism for learning free energies that is capable of capturing arbitrarily complex model dependencies on coarse-grained coordinates and finite-temperature response to variation of general system parameters. This is done by endowing models with explicit dependence on temperature and parameters and by exploiting exact differential thermodynamic relationships between the free energy, ensemble averages, and response properties. Formally, we derive an approach for learning high-dimensional cumulant generating functions using statistical estimates of their derivatives, which are observable cumulants of the underlying random variable. The proposed formalism opens ways to resolve several outstanding challenges in bottom-up molecular coarse graining dealing with multiple minima and state dependence. This is realized by using additional differential relationships in the loss function to significantly improve the learning of free energies, while exactly preserving the Boltzmann distribution governing the corresponding fine-grain all-atom system. As an example, we go beyond the standard force-matching procedure to demonstrate how leveraging the thermodynamic relationship between free energy and values of ensemble averaged all-atom potential energy improves the learning efficiency and accuracy of the free energy model. The result is significantly better sampling statistics of structural distribution functions. The theoretical framework presented here is demonstrated via implementations in both kernel-based and neural network machine learning regression methods and opens new ways to train accurate machine learning models for studying thermodynamic and response properties of complex molecular systems.">

These processes find wide application in the natural sciences and machine learning, but their inference is known to be far from trivial. In this work we introduce a methodology for zero-shot inference of Markov jump processes (MJPs), on bounded state spaces, from noisy and sparse observations, which consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observation process. Second, a neural network model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) model can infer, in a zero-shot fashion, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models. What is more, we show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art models which are finetuned to the target datasets.">

However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

        <tr id="Reduced order modeling lowers the computational cost of solving PDEs by learning a low-order spatial representation from data and dynamically evolving these representations using manifold projections of the governing equations. While commonly used, linear subspace reduced-order models (ROMs) are often suboptimal for problems with a slow decay of Kolmogorov $n$-width, such as advection-dominated fluid flows at high Reynolds numbers. There has been a growing interest in nonlinear ROMs that use state-of-the-art representation learning techniques to accurately capture such phenomena with fewer degrees of freedom. We propose smooth neural field ROM (SNF-ROM), a nonlinear reduced modeling framework that combines grid-free reduced representations with Galerkin projection. The SNF-ROM architecture constrains the learned ROM trajectories to a smoothly varying path, which proves beneficial in the dynamics evaluation when the reduced manifold is traversed in accordance with the governing PDEs. Furthermore, we devise robust regularization schemes to ensure the learned neural fields are smooth and differentiable. This allows us to compute physics-based dynamics of the reduced system nonintrusively with automatic differentiation and evolve the reduced system with classical time-integrators. SNF-ROM leads to fast offline training as well as enhanced accuracy and stability during the online dynamics evaluation. Numerical experiments reveal that SNF-ROM is able to accelerate the full-order computation by up to $199\times$. We demonstrate the efficacy of SNF-ROM on a range of advection-dominated linear and nonlinear PDE problems where we consistently outperform state-of-the-art ROMs.">

        <tr id="On the forefront of scientific computing, Deep Learning (DL), i.e., machine learning with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has emerged a powerful new tool for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution.

The computational efficiency of such surrogate models is especially important for design, exhaustive exploration and physical understanding. Plasma simulations, in particular those applied to the study of ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ plasma discharges and technologies, such as Hall thrusters, require substantial computational resources in order to resolve the multidimentional dynamics that span across wide spatial and temporal scales. Although high-fidelity computational tools are available to simulate such systems over limited conditions and in highly simplified geometries, simulations of full-size systems and/or extensive parametric studies over many geometric configurations and under different physical conditions are computationally intractable with conventional numerical tools. Thus, scientific studies and industrially oriented modeling of plasma systems, including the important ${\bf E}\times {\bf B}$ technologies, stand to significantly benefit from reduced order modeling algorithms. We develop a model reduction scheme based upon a {\em Shallow REcurrent Decoder} (SHRED) architecture. The scheme uses a neural network for encoding limited sensor measurements in time (sequence-to-sequence encoding) to full state-space reconstructions via a decoder network. Based upon the theory of separation of variables, the SHRED architecture is capable of (i) reconstructing full spatio-temporal fields with as little as three point sensors, even the fields that are not measured with sensor feeds but that are in dynamic coupling with the measured field, and (ii) forecasting the future state of the system using neural network roll-outs from the trained time encoding model.">

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

Inexpensive to evaluate, POD-DL-ROMs are also relatively fast to train, thanks to their limited complexity. However, POD-DL-ROMs account for the physical laws governing the problem at hand only through the training data, that are usually obtained through a full order model (FOM) relying on a high-fidelity discretization of the underlying equations. Moreover, the accuracy of POD-DL-ROMs strongly depends on the amount of available data. In this paper, we consider a major extension of POD-DL-ROMs by enforcing the fulfillment of the governing physical laws in the training process -- that is, by making them physics-informed -- to compensate for possible scarce and/or unavailable data and improve the overall reliability. To do that, we first complement POD-DL-ROMs with a trunk net architecture, endowing them with the ability to compute the problem's solution at every point in the spatial domain, and ultimately enabling a seamless computation of the physics-based loss by means of the strong continuous formulation. Then, we introduce an efficient training strategy that limits the notorious computational burden entailed by a physics-informed training phase. In particular, we take advantage of the few available data to develop a low-cost pre-training procedure; then, we fine-tune the architecture in order to further improve the prediction reliability. Accuracy and efficiency of the resulting pre-trained physics-informed DL-ROMs (PTPI-DL-ROMs) are then assessed on a set of test cases ranging from non-affinely parametrized advection-diffusion-reaction equations, to nonlinear problems like the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows.">

        <tr id="Reduced order models based on the transport of a lower dimensional manifold representation of the thermochemical state, such as Principal Component (PC) transport and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, have been developed to reduce the computational cost associated with the Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of reactive flows. Both PC transport and ML normally require an abundance of data to exhibit sufficient predictive accuracy, which might not be available due to the prohibitive cost of DNS or experimental data acquisition. To alleviate such difficulties, similar data from an existing dataset or domain (source domain) can be used to train ML models, potentially resulting in adequate predictions in the domain of interest (target domain). This study presents a novel probabilistic transfer learning (TL) framework to enhance the trust in ML models in correctly predicting the thermochemical state in a lower dimensional manifold and a sparse data setting. The framework uses Bayesian neural networks, and autoencoders, to reduce the dimensionality of the state space and diffuse the knowledge from the source to the target domain. The new framework is applied to one-dimensional freely-propagating flame solutions under different data sparsity scenarios. The results reveal that there is an optimal amount of knowledge to be transferred, which depends on the amount of data available in the target domain and the similarity between the domains. TL can reduce the reconstruction error by one order of magnitude for cases with large sparsity. The new framework required 10 times less data for the target domain to reproduce the same error as in the abundant data scenario. Furthermore, comparisons with a state-of-the-art deterministic TL strategy show that the probabilistic method can require four times less data to achieve the same reconstruction error.">

However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors.

Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the sparse representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.">

We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.">

        <tr id="Learning from complex, multidimensional data has become central to computational mathematics, and among the most successful high-dimensional function approximators are deep neural networks (DNNs). Training DNNs is posed as an optimization problem to learn network weights or parameters that well-approximate a mapping from input to target data. Multiway data or tensors arise naturally in myriad ways in deep learning, in particular as input data and as high-dimensional weights and features extracted by the network, with the latter often being a bottleneck in terms of speed and memory. In this work, we leverage tensor representations and processing to efficiently parameterize DNNs when learning from high-dimensional data. We propose tensor neural networks (t-NNs), a natural extension of traditional fully-connected networks, that can be trained efficiently in a reduced, yet more powerful parameter space. Our t-NNs are built upon matrix-mimetic tensor-tensor products, which retain algebraic properties of matrix multiplication while capturing high-dimensional correlations. Mimeticity enables t-NNs to inherit desirable properties of modern DNN architectures. We exemplify this by extending recent work on stable neural networks, which interpret DNNs as discretizations of differential equations, to our multidimensional framework. We provide empirical evidence of the parametric advantages of t-NNs on dimensionality reduction using autoencoders and classification using fully-connected and stable variants on benchmark imaging datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.">

In this study, we explore the use of deep learning techniques to solve this nonlinear identification problem. We specifically focus on extracting dynamic models of simple deformable objects from the high-dimensional sensor input coming from an RGB camera. We investigate a two-stage approach to achieve this goal. First, we train a variational autoencoder to extract an extremely low-dimensional representation of the object configuration.

In this paper we leverage the universal approximation properties of neural networks (NNs) to develop neural DeePC algorithms for nonlinear systems. Firstly, we point out that the outputs of the last hidden layer of a deep NN implicitly construct a basis in a so-called neural (feature) space, while the output linear layer performs affine interpolation in the neural space. As such, we can train off-line a deep NN using large data sets of trajectories to learn the neural basis and compute on-line a suitable affine interpolation using DeePC. Secondly, methods for guaranteeing consistency of neural DeePC and for reducing computational complexity are developed. Several neural DeePC formulations are illustrated on a nonlinear pendulum example.">

        <tr id="Understanding the mechanisms underlying crystal formation is crucial. For most systems, crystallization typically goes through a nucleation process that involves dynamics that happen at short time and length scales. Due to this, molecular dynamics serves as a powerful tool to study this phenomenon. Existing approaches to study the mechanism often focus analysis on static snapshots of the global configuration, potentially overlooking subtle local fluctuations and history of the atoms involved in the formation of solid nuclei. To address this limitation, we propose a methodology that categorizes nucleation pathways into reactive pathways based on the time evolution of constituent atoms. Our approach effectively captures the diverse structural pathways explored by crystallizing Lennard-Jones-like particles and solidifying Ni$_3$Al, providing a more nuanced understanding of nucleating pathways. Moreover, our methodology enables the prediction of the resulting polymorph from each reactive trajectory. This deep learning-assisted comprehensive analysis offers an alternative view of crystal nucleation mechanisms and pathways.">

        <tr id="Thanks to their simple architecture, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting interpretable insights from data. However, training RBMs, as other energy-based models, on highly structured data poses a major challenge, as effective training relies on mixing the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations used to estimate the gradient. This process is often hindered by multiple second-order phase transitions and the associated critical slowdown. In this paper, we present an innovative method in which the principal directions of the dataset are integrated into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization procedure. This approach enables efficient sampling of the equilibrium measure via a static Monte Carlo process. By starting the standard training process with a model that already accurately represents the main modes of the data, we bypass the initial phase transitions. Our results show that this strategy successfully trains RBMs to capture the full diversity of data in datasets where previous methods fail. Furthermore, we use the training trajectories to propose a new sampling method, {\em parallel trajectory tempering}, which allows us to sample the equilibrium measure of the trained model much faster than previous optimized MCMC approaches and a better estimation of the log-likelihood. We illustrate the success of the training method on several highly structured datasets.">

Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.">

        <tr id="To generate coherent responses, language models infer unobserved meaning from their input text sequence. One potential explanation for this capability arises from theories of delay embeddings in dynamical systems, which prove that unobserved variables can be recovered from the history of only a handful of observed variables. To test whether language models are effectively constructing delay embeddings, we measure the capacities of sequence models to reconstruct unobserved dynamics. We trained 1-layer transformer decoders and state-space sequence models on next-step prediction from noisy, partially-observed time series data. We found that each sequence layer can learn a viable embedding of the underlying system. However, state-space models have a stronger inductive bias than transformers-in particular, they more effectively reconstruct unobserved information at initialization, leading to more parameter-efficient models and lower error on dynamics tasks. Our work thus forges a novel connection between dynamical systems and deep learning sequence models via delay embedding theory.">

However, sampling these paths via molecular dynamics simulations is computationally prohibitive due to the high-energy barriers between the meta-stable states. Recent machine learning approaches are often restricted to simple systems or rely on collective variables (CVs) extracted from expensive domain knowledge. In this work, we propose to leverage generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to sample transition paths without relying on CVs. We reformulate the problem as amortized energy-based sampling over molecular trajectories and train a bias potential by minimizing the squared log-ratio between the target distribution and the generator, derived from the flow matching objective of GFlowNets. Our evaluation on three proteins (Alanine Dipeptide, Polyproline, and Chignolin) demonstrates that our approach, called TPS-GFN, generates more realistic and diverse transition paths than the previous CV-free machine learning approach.">

Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks.

        <tr id="In order to extract governing equations from time-series data, various approaches are proposed. Among those, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) stands out as a successful method capable of modeling governing equations with a minimal number of terms, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing. This feature, which relies on a small number of terms, is crucial for interpretability. The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.">

We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs.

The machine learning model overcomes the inherent limitations in traditional long short-time memory networks by exploiting a conditional Gaussian structure informed of the essential physical dynamics. The model performance is demonstrated under a prototype model from idealized geophysical flow and passive tracers, which exhibits analytical solutions with representative statistical features. Many attractive properties are found in the trained model in recovering the hidden dynamics using a limited dataset and sparse observation time, showing uniformly high skill with persistent numerical stability in predicting both the trajectory and statistical solutions among different statistical regimes away from the training regime.

A viable approach to overcome this limitation is to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However, potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties, leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy) unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based MLP towards higher accuracy.

For nonequilibrium systems, perturbations cannot be interpreted simply by monitoring fluctuations in a conjugate observable -- additional dynamical information is needed. The theory of linear response around nonequilibrium steady states relies on path ensemble averaging, which makes this theory inapplicable to perturbations that affect the diffusion constant or temperature in a stochastic system. Here, we show that a separate, ``effective'' physical process can be used to describe the perturbed dynamics and that this dynamics in turn allows us to accurately calculate the response to a change in the diffusion. Interestingly, the effective dynamics contains an additional drift that is proportional to the ``score'' of the instantaneous probability density of the system -- this object has also been studied extensively in recent years in the context of denoising diffusion models in the machine learning literature. Exploiting recently developed algorithms for learning the score, we show that we can carry out nonequilibrium response calculations on systems for which the exact score cannot be obtained.">

        <tr id="One of the central goals of neuroscience is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the dynamics of neural circuits give rise to their observed function. A popular approach towards this end is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to reproduce experimental recordings of neural activity. These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. Our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics.">

A theoretical comparison of the computational aspects of these algorithms is presented, where several benefits of the penalty-based method are identified. Our main contributions include an automatic mechanism for tuning the scale of the penalty terms, an updated form of the overlap penalty with proven convergence properties, and a new term that penalizes the spin of the wave function, enabling the selective computation of states with a given spin. With these improvements, along with the use of the latest self-attention-based ansatz, the penalty-based method achieves a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol for the vertical excitation energies of a set of 26 atoms and molecules, without relying on variance matching schemes. Considering excited states along the dissociation of the carbon dimer, the accuracy of the penalty-based method is on par with that of natural-excited-state (NES) VMC, while also providing results for larger sections of the potential energy surface. Additionally, the accuracy of the original penalty-based method is improved for a conical intersection of ethylene, with the predicted angle of the intersection agreeing well with both NES-VMC and multi-reference configuration interaction.">

        <tr id="The task of sampling from a probability density can be approached as transporting a tractable density function to the target, known as dynamical measure transport. In this work, we tackle it through a principled unified framework using deterministic or stochastic evolutions described by partial differential equations (PDEs). This framework incorporates prior trajectory-based sampling methods, such as diffusion models or Schr\"odinger bridges, without relying on the concept of time-reversals. Moreover, it allows us to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus sampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization constant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and computational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and discretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading to significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to alternative methods. Moreover, they can readily be fine-tuned with Gauss-Newton methods to achieve high accuracy in sampling.">

        <tr id="In this article, a distributed neural network modeling framework including a novel neural hybrid system model is proposed for enhancing the scalability of neural network models in modeling dynamical systems. First, high-dimensional training data samples will be mapped to a low-dimensional feature space through the principal component analysis (PCA) featuring process. Following that, the feature space is bisected into multiple partitions based on the variation of the Shannon entropy under the maximum entropy (ME) bisecting process. The behavior of subsystems in the prespecified state space partitions will then be approximated using a group of shallow neural networks (SNNs) known as extreme learning machines (ELMs), and then it can further simplify the model by merging the redundant lattices based on their training error performance. The proposed modeling framework can handle high-dimensional dynamical system modeling problems with the advantages of reducing model complexity and improving model performance in training and verification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework, examples of modeling the LASA dataset and an industrial robot are presented.">

        <tr id="Markov state modeling has gained popularity in various scientific fields due to its ability to reduce complex time series data into transitions between a few states. Yet, current frameworks are limited by assuming a single Markov chain describes the data, and they suffer an inability to discern heterogeneities. As a solution, this paper proposes a variational expectation-maximization algorithm that identifies a mixture of Markov chains in a time-series data set. The method is agnostic to the definition of the Markov states, whether data-driven (e.g. by spectral clustering) or based on domain knowledge. Variational EM efficiently and organically identifies the number of Markov chains and dynamics of each chain without expensive model comparisons or posterior sampling. The approach is supported by a theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including simulated and observational data sets based on ${\tt Last.fm}$ music listening, ultramarathon running, and gene expression. The results show the new algorithm is competitive with contemporary mixture modeling approaches and powerful in identifying meaningful heterogeneities in time series data.">

        <tr id="Machine learning has been proposed as an alternative to theoretical modeling when dealing with complex problems in biological physics. However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is “learnable” and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

To this end, we introduce a multi-purpose framework to the representation learning community, which allows to: (i) compare different spaces in an interpretable way and measure their intrinsic similarity; (ii) find correspondences between them, both in unsupervised and weakly supervised settings, and (iii) to effectively transfer representations between distinct spaces.

        <tr id="Coarse-graining is a molecular modeling technique in which an atomistic system is represented in a simplified fashion that retains the most significant system features that contribute to a target output, while removing the degrees of freedom that are less relevant. This reduction in model complexity allows coarse-grained molecular simulations to reach increased spatial and temporal scales compared to corresponding all-atom models. A core challenge in coarse-graining is to construct a force field that represents the interactions in the new representation in a way that preserves the atomistic-level properties. Many approaches to building coarse-grained force fields have limited transferability between different thermodynamic conditions as a result of averaging over internal fluctuations at a specific thermodynamic state point. Here, we use a graph-convolutional neural network architecture, the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network with Tensor Sensitivity (HIP-NN-TS), to develop a highly automated training pipeline for coarse grained force fields which allows for studying the transferability of coarse-grained models based on the force-matching approach. We show that this approach not only yields highly accurate force fields, but also that these force fields are more transferable through a variety of thermodynamic conditions. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks to improve the construction of transferable coarse-grained force fields.">

        <tr id="This paper introduces alternators, a novel family of non-Markovian dynamical models for sequences. An alternator features two neural networks: the observation trajectory network (OTN) and the feature trajectory network (FTN). The OTN and the FTN work in conjunction, alternating between outputting samples in the observation space and some feature space, respectively, over a cycle. The parameters of the OTN and the FTN are not time-dependent and are learned via a minimum cross-entropy criterion over the trajectories. Alternators are versatile. They can be used as dynamical latent-variable generative models or as sequence-to-sequence predictors. When alternators are used as generative models, the FTN produces interpretable low-dimensional latent variables that capture the dynamics governing the observations. When alternators are used as sequence-to-sequence predictors, the FTN learns to predict the observed features. In both cases, the OTN learns to produce sequences that match the data. Alternators can uncover the latent dynamics underlying complex sequential data, accurately forecast and impute missing data, and sample new trajectories. We showcase the capabilities of alternators in three applications. We first used alternators to model the Lorenz equations, often used to describe chaotic behavior. We then applied alternators to Neuroscience, to map brain activity to physical activity. Finally, we applied alternators to Climate Science, focusing on sea-surface temperature forecasting. In all our experiments, we found alternators are stable to train, fast to sample from, yield high-quality generated samples and latent variables, and outperform strong baselines such as neural ODEs and diffusion models in the domains we studied.">

        <tr id="Machine learning (ML) methods provide advanced means for understanding inherent patterns within large and complex datasets.

Four molecular descriptors were considered: radial distribution functions (RDFs), mean square displacements (MSDs), relative square displacements (RSDs), and dihedral angles (DAs). By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to analyze the PCA and DM projections, and by quantifying their log-likelihoods as a density-based metric, a distinct separation into two populations corresponding to melt and glass states was revealed. This separation enabled the $T_\mathrm{g}$ evaluation from a cooling-induced sharp increase in the overlap between log-likelihood distributions at different temperatures. $T_\mathrm{g}$ values derived from the RDF and MSD descriptors using DM closely matched the standard computer simulation-based dilatometric and dynamic $T_\mathrm{g}$ values for both PLA and PHB models. This was not the case for PCA. The DM-transformed DA and RSD data resulted in $T_\mathrm{g}$ values in agreement with experimental ones. Overall, the fusion of atomistic simulations and diffusion maps complemented with the Gaussian Mixture Models presents a promising framework for computing $T_\mathrm{g}$ and studying the glass transition in a unified way across various molecular descriptors for glass-forming materials.">

The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="This work presents an efficient approach for accelerating multilevel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for large-scale problems using low-fidelity machine learning models. While conventional techniques for large-scale Bayesian inference often substitute computationally expensive high-fidelity models with machine learning models, thereby introducing approximation errors, our approach offers a computationally efficient alternative by augmenting high-fidelity models with low-fidelity ones within a hierarchical framework. The multilevel approach utilizes the low-fidelity machine learning model (MLM) for inexpensive evaluation of proposed samples thereby improving the acceptance of samples by the high-fidelity model. The hierarchy in our multilevel algorithm is derived from geometric multigrid hierarchy. We utilize an MLM to acclerate the coarse level sampling. Training machine learning model for the coarsest level significantly reduces the computational cost associated with generating training data and training the model. We present an MCMC algorithm to accelerate the coarsest level sampling using MLM and account for the approximation error introduced. We provide theoretical proofs of detailed balance and demonstrate that our multilevel approach constitutes a consistent MCMC algorithm. Additionally, we derive conditions on the accuracy of the machine learning model to facilitate more efficient hierarchical sampling. Our technique is demonstrated on a standard benchmark inference problem in groundwater flow, where we estimate the probability density of a quantity of interest using a four-level MCMC algorithm. Our proposed algorithm accelerates multilevel sampling by a factor of two while achieving similar accuracy compared to sampling using the standard multilevel algorithm.">

        <tr id="We quantify the efficiency of temporal difference (TD) learning over the direct, or Monte Carlo (MC), estimator for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on estimation of quantities related to rare events. Policy evaluation is complicated in the rare event setting by the long timescale of the event and by the need for \emph{relative accuracy} in estimates of very small values. Specifically, we focus on least-squares TD (LSTD) prediction for finite state Markov chains, and show that LSTD can achieve relative accuracy far more efficiently than MC. We prove a central limit theorem for the LSTD estimator and upper bound the \emph{relative asymptotic variance} by simple quantities characterizing the connectivity of states relative to the transition probabilities between them. Using this bound, we show that, even when both the timescale of the rare event and the relative accuracy of the MC estimator are exponentially large in the number of states, LSTD maintains a fixed level of relative accuracy with a total number of observed transitions of the Markov chain that is only \emph{polynomially} large in the number of states.">

        <tr id="Predicting the conditional evolution of Volterra processes with stochastic volatility is a crucial challenge in mathematical finance. While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems. To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.">

However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a denoising-diffusion objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI is capable of coupling hundreds of degrees of freedom at once.">

This method is used to quantify uncertainty in the inverse PDE PINN solutions. Recently, the Bayesian PINN (BPINN) method was proposed, where the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters was formulated using the Bayes' theorem and sampled using approximate inference methods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference (VI) methods. In this work, we demonstrate that HMC fails to converge for non-linear inverse PDE problems. As an alternative to HMC, we sample the distribution by solving the stochastic optimization problem obtained by randomizing the PINN loss function. The effectiveness of the rPINN method is tested for linear and non-linear Poisson equations, and the diffusion equation with a high-dimensional space-dependent diffusion coefficient. The rPINN method provides informative distributions for all considered problems. For the linear Poisson equation, HMC and rPINN produce similar distributions, but rPINN is on average 27 times faster than HMC. For the non-linear Poison and diffusion equations, the HMC method fails to converge because a single HMC chain cannot sample multiple modes of the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters in a reasonable amount of time.">

Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion model and energy-based model, we develop Diffusion Spectral Representation (Diff-SR), a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-SR facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-SR in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings.">

We show how to embed two existing AD particle filter methods in a theoretical framework that provides an extension to a new class of algorithms. This new class permits a bias/variance tradeoff and hence a mean squared error substantially lower than the existing algorithms. We develop likelihood maximization algorithms suited to the Monte Carlo properties of the AD gradient estimate. Our algorithms require only a differentiable simulator for the latent dynamic system; by contrast, most previous approaches to AD likelihood maximization for particle filters require access to the system's transition probabilities. Numerical results indicate that a hybrid algorithm that uses AD to refine a coarse solution from an iterated filtering algorithm show substantial improvement on current state-of-the-art methods for a challenging scientific benchmark problem.">

However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization.

In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm.

Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monde Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.">

In this work, we analyze an efficient approach to identifying skillful ROMs with a sparse structure using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. The causation entropy quantifies in a statistical way the additional contribution of each term to the underlying dynamics beyond the information already captured by all the other terms in the ansatz. By doing so, the causation entropy assesses the importance of each term to the dynamics before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. Thus, the approach can be utilized to eliminate terms with little dynamic impact, leading to a parsimonious structure that retains the essential physics. To circumvent the difficulty of estimating high-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) involved in the causation entropy computation, we leverage Gaussian approximations for such PDFs, which are demonstrated to be sufficient even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian dynamics. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by building sparse causation-based ROMs for various purposes, such as recovering long-term statistics and inferring unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for processing relational data in applications. However, GNNs suffer from the problem of oversmoothing, the property that the features of all nodes exponentially converge to the same vector over layers, prohibiting the design of deep GNNs. In this work we study oversmoothing in graph convolutional networks (GCNs) by using their Gaussian process (GP) equivalence in the limit of infinitely many hidden features. By generalizing methods from conventional deep neural networks (DNNs), we can describe the distribution of features at the output layer of deep GCNs in terms of a GP: as expected, we find that typical parameter choices from the literature lead to oversmoothing. The theory, however, allows us to identify a new, nonoversmoothing phase: if the initial weights of the network have sufficiently large variance, GCNs do not oversmooth, and node features remain informative even at large depth. We demonstrate the validity of this prediction in finite-size GCNs by training a linear classifier on their output. Moreover, using the linearization of the GCN GP, we generalize the concept of propagation depth of information from DNNs to GCNs. This propagation depth diverges at the transition between the oversmoothing and non-oversmoothing phase. We test the predictions of our approach and find good agreement with finite-size GCNs. Initializing GCNs near the transition to the non-oversmoothing phase, we obtain networks which are both deep and expressive.">

We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

It is important to construct learning architectures with theoretical guarantees to permit safety in the applications. There has been considerable progress in this direction lately. In particular, symplectic networks were shown to have the non vanishing gradient property, essential for numerical stability. On the other hand, architectures based on higher order numerical methods were shown to be efficient in many tasks where the learned function has an underlying dynamical structure. In this work we construct symplectic networks based on higher order explicit methods with non vanishing gradient property and test their efficiency on various examples.">

        <tr id="The rapid progress of single-cell technology has facilitated faster and more cost-effective acquisition of diverse omics data, enabling biologists to unravel the intricacies of cell populations, disease states, and developmental lineages. Additionally, the advent of multimodal single-cell omics technologies has opened up new avenues for studying interactions within biological systems. However, the high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse nature of single-cell omics data poses significant analytical challenges. Therefore, dimension reduction (DR) techniques play a vital role in analyzing such data. While many DR methods have been developed, each has its limitations. For instance, linear methods like PCA struggle to capture the highly diverse and complex associations between cell types and states effectively. In response, nonlinear techniques have been introduced; however, they may face scalability issues in high-dimensional settings, be restricted to single omics data, or primarily focus on visualization rather than producing informative embeddings for downstream tasks. Here, we formally introduce DCOL (Dissimilarity based on Conditional Ordered List) correlation, a functional dependency measure for quantifying nonlinear relationships between variables. Based on this measure, we propose DCOL-PCA and DCOL-CCA, for dimension reduction and integration of single- and multi-omics data. In simulation studies, our methods outperformed eight other DR methods and four joint dimension reduction (jDR) methods, showcasing stable performance across various settings. It proved highly effective in extracting essential factors even in the most challenging scenarios. We also validated these methods on real datasets, with our method demonstrating its ability to detect intricate signals within and between omics data and generate lower-dimensional embeddings that preserve the essential information and latent structures in the data.">

        <tr id="We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.">

To address such discontinuities Aldous introduced the extended weak convergence, which can fully characterise all essential properties, including the filtration, of stochastic processes; however was considered to be hard to find efficient numerical implementations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric called High Rank PCF Distance (HRPCFD) for extended weak convergence based on the high rank path development method from rough path theory, which also defines the characteristic function for measure-valued processes. We then show that such HRPCFD admits many favourable analytic properties which allows us to design an efficient algorithm for training HRPCFD from data and construct the HRPCF-GAN by using HRPCFD as the discriminator for conditional time series generation. Our numerical experiments on both hypothesis testing and generative modelling validate the out-performance of our approach compared with several state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential in broad applications of synthetic time series generation and in addressing classic financial and economic challenges, such as optimal stopping or utility maximisation problems.">

        <tr id="In the gravitational-wave analysis of pulsar-timing-array datasets, parameter estimation is usually performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to explore posterior probability densities. We introduce an alternative procedure that relies instead on stochastic gradient-descent Bayesian variational inference, whereby we obtain the weights of a neural-network approximation of the posterior by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the approximation from the exact posterior. This technique is distinct from simulation-based inference with normalizing flows, since we train the network for a single dataset, rather than the population of all possible datasets, and we require the computation of the data likelihood and its gradient. Unlike Markov Chain methods, our technique can transparently exploit highly parallel computing platforms. This makes it extremely fast on modern graphical processing units, where it can analyze the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset in few tens of minutes, depending on the probabilistic model, as opposed to hours or days with the analysis codes used until now. We expect that this speed will unlock new kinds of astrophysical and cosmological studies of pulsar-timing-array datasets. Furthermore, variational inference would be viable in other contexts of gravitational-wave data analysis as long as differentiable and parallelizable likelihoods are available.">

This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.">

Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

The recent advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) indicates that there is potential to revisit and enhance the previously MLP-based PINNs. Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN's potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.">

Large scale dynamical simulations of the JT model also shed light on the orbital ordering dynamics in colossal magnetoresistance manganites. The JT effect in these materials describes the distortion of local oxygen octahedra driven by a coupling to the orbital degrees of freedom of $e_g$ electrons. An effective electron-mediated interaction between the local JT modes leads to a structural transition and the emergence of long-range orbital order at low temperatures. Assuming the principle of locality, a deep-learning neural-network model is developed to accurately and efficiently predict the electron-induced forces that drive the dynamical evolution of JT phonons. A group-theoretical method is utilized to develop a descriptor that incorporates the combined orbital and lattice symmetry into the ML model. Large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening dynamics of the composite JT distortion and orbital order after a thermal quench. The late-stage coarsening of orbital domains exhibits pronounced freezing behaviors which are likely related to the unusual morphology of the domain structures.

This phenomenon, known as causal emergence, is quantified by the indicator of effective information. However, two challenges confront this theory: the absence of well-developed frameworks in continuous stochastic dynamical systems and the reliance on coarse-graining methodologies. In this study, we introduce an exact theoretic framework for causal emergence within linear stochastic iteration systems featuring continuous state spaces and Gaussian noise. Building upon this foundation, we derive an analytical expression for effective information across general dynamics and identify optimal linear coarse-graining strategies that maximize the degree of causal emergence when the dimension averaged uncertainty eliminated by coarse-graining has an upper bound. Our investigation reveals that the maximal causal emergence and the optimal coarse-graining methods are primarily determined by the principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the dynamic system's parameter matrix, with the latter not being unique. To validate our propositions, we apply our analytical models to three simplified physical systems, comparing the outcomes with numerical simulations, and consistently achieve congruent results.">

This method transforms AlphaFold2 into a diffusion model by implementing a conformation-based diffusion process and adapting the architecture to process diffused inputs effectively. To counteract the inherent conformational bias in the Protein Data Bank, we developed a novel hierarchical reweighting protocol based on structural clustering. Our evaluations demonstrate that Diffold outperforms existing methods in terms of successful sampling and structural validity. The comparisons with long time molecular dynamics show that Diffold can overcome the energy barrier existing in molecular dynamics simulations and perform more efficient sampling. Furthermore, We showcase Diffold’s utility in drug discovery through its application in neural protein-ligand docking. In a blind test, it accurately predicted a novel protein-ligand complex, underscoring its potential to impact real-world biological research.

        <tr id="Proteins are dynamic systems whose structural preferences determine their function. Unfortunately, building atomically detailed models of protein structural ensembles remains challenging, limiting our understanding of the relationships between sequence, structure, and function. Combining single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments with molecular dynamics simulations could provide experimentally grounded, all-atom models of a protein’s structural ensemble. However, agreement between the two techniques is often insufficient to achieve this goal. Here, we explore whether accounting for important experimental details like averaging across structures sampled during a given smFRET measurement is responsible for this apparent discrepancy. We present an approach to account for this time-averaging by leveraging the kinetic information available from Markov state models of a protein’s dynamics. This allows us to accurately assess which timescales are averaged during an experiment. We find this approach significantly improves agreement between simulations and experiments in proteins with varying degrees of dynamics, including the well-ordered protein T4 lysozyme, the partially disordered protein apolipoprotein E (ApoE), and a disordered amyloid protein (Aβ40). We find evidence for hidden states that are not apparent in smFRET experiments because of time averaging with other structures, akin to states in fast exchange in NMR, and evaluate different force fields. Finally, we show how remaining discrepancies between computations and experiments can be used to guide additional simulations and build structural models for states that were previously unaccounted for. We expect our approach will enable combining simulations and experiments to understand the link between sequence, structure, and function in many settings.">

By unknown manifolds, we identify the manifold by a set of randomly sampled data point clouds that are assumed to lie on or close to the manifold. When the loss function incorporates the physics, resulting in the so-called physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), we approximate the differentiation terms in the PDE by an appropriate operator approximation scheme. For the second-order elliptic PDE with a nontrivial diffusion coefficient, we approximate the differentiation term with one of these methods: the Diffusion Maps (DM), the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), and the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) methods. For the GMLS approximation, which is more flexible for problems with boundary conditions, we derive the theoretical error bound induced by the approximate differentiation. Numerically, we found that DeepONet is accurate for various types of diffusion coefficients, including linear, exponential, piecewise linear, and quadratic functions, for linear and semi-linear PDEs with/without boundaries. When the number of observations is small, PI-DeepONet trained with sufficiently large samples of PDE constraints produces more accurate approximations than DeepONet. For the inverse problem, we incorporate PI-DeepONet in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy solutions of the PDEs measured at a finite number of point cloud data. Numerically, we found that PI-DeepONet provides accurate approximations comparable to those obtained by a more expensive method that directly solves the PDE on the proposed diffusion coefficient in each MCMC iteration.">

        <tr id="The brain needs to perform time-critical computations to ensure survival. A potential solution lies in the non-local, distributed computation at the whole-brain level made possible by criticality and amplified by the rare long-range connections found in the brain’s unique anatomical structure. This non-locality can be captured by the mathematical structure of Schrödinger’s wave equation, which is at the heart of the novel CHARM (Complex Harmonics decomposition) framework that performs the necessary dimensional manifold reduction able to extract non-locality in critical spacetime brain dynamics. Using a large neuroimaging dataset of over 1,000 people, CHARM captured the critical, non-local/long-range nature of brain dynamics and the underlying mechanisms were established using a precise whole-brain model. Equally, CHARM revealed the significantly different critical dynamics of wakefulness and sleep. Overall, CHARM is a promising theoretical framework for capturing the low-dimensionality of the complex network dynamics observed in neuroscience and provides evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of critical brain dynamics.">

We assume that a good proposal kernel to move only a subset of the degrees of freedoms (also known as collective variables) is known a priori. This proposal kernel can for example be built using normalizing flows. We show how to extend the move from the collective variable space to the full space and how to implement an accept-reject step in order to get a reversible chain with respect to a target probability measure. The accept-reject step does not require to know the marginal of the original measure in the collective variable (namely to know the free energy). The obtained algorithm admits several variants, some of them being very close to methods which have been proposed previously in the literature. We show how the obtained acceptance ratio can be expressed in terms of the work which appears in the Jarzynski-Crooks equality, at least for some variants. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on various simple test cases, and allow us to compare the variants of the algorithm.">

Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.">

In this study, we rigorously develop a partial differential equation (PDE) that unravels the frequency dynamics of the error for a 2-layer NN in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime. Furthermore, using this insight, we explicitly demonstrate how an appropriate choice of distributions for the initialization weights can eliminate or control the frequency bias. We focus our study on the Fourier Features model, an NN where the first layer has sine and cosine activation functions, with frequencies sampled from a prescribed distribution. In this setup, we experimentally validate our theoretical results and compare the NN dynamics to the solution of the PDE using the finite element method. Finally, we empirically show that the same principle extends to multi-layer NNs.">

We present an accurate and data-efficient protocol based on fine-tuning of the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and showcase its capabilities on sublimation enthalpies and physical properties of ice polymorphs. Our approach requires only a few tens of training structures to achieve sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the sublimation enthalpies and sub 1 % error in densities for polymorphs at finite temperature and pressure. Exploiting this data efficiency, we explore simulations of hexagonal ice at the random phase approximation level of theory at experimental temperatures and pressures, calculating its physical properties, like pair correlation function and density, with good agreement with experiments. Our approach provides a way forward for predicting the stability of molecular crystals at finite thermodynamic conditions with the accuracy of correlated electronic structure theory.">

Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states.

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

However, the computational prediction of the relative stability between phases based on their free energy is a daunting task, as traditional free energy estimators require a large amount of simulation data to obtain uncorrelated equilibrium samples over a grid of thermodynamic states. In this work, we develop deep generative machine learning models for entire phase diagrams, employing normalizing flows conditioned on the thermodynamic states, e.g., temperature and pressure, that they map to. By training a single normalizing flow to transform the equilibrium distribution sampled at only one reference thermodynamic state to a wide range of target temperatures and pressures, we can efficiently generate equilibrium samples across the entire phase diagram. Using a permutation-equivariant architecture allows us, thereby, to treat solid and liquid phases on the same footing. We demonstrate our approach by predicting the solid-liquid coexistence line for a Lennard-Jones system in excellent agreement with state-of-the-art free energy methods while significantly reducing the number of energy evaluations needed.">

The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs, including faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability, and lower parameter counts when compared against MLPs. We demonstrate these benefits in three test cases: the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, Burgers' equation, and the Fisher-KPP PDE. We showcase the strong performance of parameter-lean KAN-ODE systems generally in reconstructing entire dynamical systems, and also in targeted applications to the inference of a source term in an otherwise known flow field. We additionally demonstrate the interpretability of KAN-ODEs via activation function visualization and symbolic regression of trained results. The successful training of KAN-ODEs and their improved performance when compared to traditional Neural ODEs implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications.">

To close this gap, we introduce flow map matching -- an algorithm that learns the two-time flow map of an underlying ordinary differential equation. The approach leads to an efficient few-step generative model whose step count can be chosen a-posteriori to smoothly trade off accuracy for computational expense. Leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework, we introduce losses for both direct training of flow maps and distillation from pre-trained (or otherwise known) velocity fields. Theoretically, we show that our approach unifies many existing few-step generative models, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, progressive distillation, and neural operator approaches, which can be obtained as particular cases of our formalism.

This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing particularly on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples is $n=\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) first, we identify under which conditions a \textit{trivial subspace} can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!>\!0$; (ii) second, in the case where the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an {\it easy subspace} consisting of directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!>\!\alpha_c$. The critical threshold $\alpha_{c}$ marks the presence of a computational phase transition, in the sense that no efficient iterative algorithm can succeed for $\alpha\!<\!\alpha_c$. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions -- akin to the parity problem -- $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where some directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. Our analytical approach is built on the optimality of approximate message-passing algorithms among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent.">

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

        <tr id="This work introduces a novel, simple, and flexible method to quantify irreversibility in generic high-dimensional time series based on the well-known mapping to a binary classification problem. Our approach utilizes gradient boosting for estimation, providing a model-free, nonlinear analysis able to handle large-dimensional systems while requiring minimal or no calibration. Our procedure is divided into three phases: trajectory encoding, Markovian order identification, and hypothesis testing for variable interactions. The latter is the key innovation that allows us to selectively switch off variable interactions to discern their specific contribution to irreversibility. When applied to financial markets, our findings reveal a distinctive shift: during stable periods, irreversibility is mainly related to short-term patterns, whereas in unstable periods, these short-term patterns are disrupted, leaving only contributions from stable long-term ones. This observed transition underscores the crucial importance of high-order variable interactions in understanding the dynamics of financial markets, especially in times of turbulence.">

Recently, the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been introduced as one of the most promising tools to solve systems of differential equations guided by some physically grounded constraints. In the quantum realm, such approach paves the way to a novel approach to solve the Schroedinger equation for non-integrable systems. By following an unsupervised learning approach, we apply the PINNs to the anharmonic oscillator in which an interaction term proportional to the fourth power of the position coordinate is present. We compute the eigenenergies and the corresponding eigenfunctions while varying the weight of the quartic interaction. We bridge our solutions to the regime where both the perturbative and the strong coupling theory work, including the pure quartic oscillator. We investigate systems with real and imaginary frequency, laying the foundation for novel numerical methods to tackle problems emerging in quantum field theory.">

These efforts focus on inverse problems that are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop an asymptotic Sobolev norm learning curve for kernel ridge(less) regression when addressing (elliptical) linear inverse problems. Our results show that the PDE operators in the inverse problem can stabilize the variance and even behave benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, exhibiting different behaviors from regression problems. Besides, our investigation also demonstrates the impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as a form of implicit regularization. For the regularized least squares estimator, we find that all considered inductive biases can achieve the optimal convergence rate, provided the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen. The convergence rate is actually independent to the choice of (smooth enough) inductive bias for both ridge and ridgeless regression. Surprisingly, our smoothness requirement recovered the condition found in Bayesian setting and extend the conclusion to the minimum norm interpolation estimators.">

Consequently, we seek to represent a learnable distribution of high-performance preconditioners from a low-dimensional subspace through a carefully-designed autoencoder, which is able to generate SPAI preconditioners for these systems.

Despite their success, traditional VAEs rely on continuous latent variables, which deviates sharply from the discrete nature of biological neurons. Here, we developed the Poisson VAE (P-VAE), a novel architecture that combines principles of predictive coding with a VAE that encodes inputs into discrete spike counts. Combining Poisson-distributed latent variables with predictive coding introduces a metabolic cost term in the model loss function, suggesting a relationship with sparse coding which we verify empirically. Additionally, we analyze the geometry of learned representations, contrasting the P-VAE to alternative VAE models. We find that the P-VAEencodes its inputs in relatively higher dimensions, facilitating linear separability of categories in a downstream classification task with a much better (5x) sample efficiency. Our work provides an interpretable computational framework to study brain-like sensory processing and paves the way for a deeper understanding of perception as an inferential process.">

However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.">

However, existing dimension reduction methods often discuss communication in the absence of a formal framework, while frameworks proposed to address this gap are impractical in data analysis. This work bridges the formal framework of M-Information Flow with practical analysis of real neural data. To this end, we propose Iterative Regression, a message-dependent linear dimension reduction technique that iteratively finds an orthonormal basis such that each basis vector maximizes correlation between the projected data and the message. We then define 'M-forwarding' to formally capture the notion of a message being forwarded from one neural population to another. We apply our methodology to recordings we collected from two neural populations in a simplified model of whisker-based sensory detection in mice, and show that the low-dimensional M-forwarding structure we infer supports biological evidence of a similar structure between the two original, high-dimensional populations.">

In this work, we first extend the policy-guided method to deal with a general state space, comprising for instance both discrete and continuous degrees of freedom, and then apply it to a few paradigmatic models of glass-forming mixtures. We assess the efficiency of a set of physically-inspired moves, whose proposal distributions are optimized through on-policy learning. Compared to conventional Monte Carlo methods, the optimized proposals are two orders of magnitude faster for an additive soft sphere mixture, but yield a much more limited speed-up for the well-studied Kob-Andersen model.

        <tr id="In this paper, we provide a multiscale perspective on the problem of maximum marginal likelihood estimation. We consider and analyse a diffusion-based maximum marginal likelihood estimation scheme using ideas from multiscale dynamics. Our perspective is based on stochastic averaging; we make an explicit connection between ideas in applied probability and parameter inference in computational statistics. In particular, we consider a general class of coupled Langevin diffusions for joint inference of latent variables and parameters in statistical models, where the latent variables are sampled from a fast Langevin process (which acts as a sampler), and the parameters are updated using a slow Langevin process (which acts as an optimiser). We show that the resulting system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be viewed as a two-time scale system. To demonstrate the utility of such a perspective, we show that the averaged parameter dynamics obtained in the limit of scale separation can be used to estimate the optimal parameter, within the strongly convex setting. We do this by using recent uniform-in-time non-asymptotic averaging bounds. Finally, we conclude by showing that the slow-fast algorithm we consider here, termed Slow-Fast Langevin Algorithm, performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on a variety of examples. We believe that the stochastic averaging approach we provide in this paper enables us to look at these algorithms from a fresh angle, as well as unlocking the path to develop and analyse new methods using well-established averaging principles.">

        <tr id="Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.">

Previous memory reduction techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and ReLoRA, suffer from the limitation of low rank and saddle point issues, particularly during intensive tasks like pre-training. In this paper, we propose Sparse Spectral Training (SST), an advanced training methodology that updates all singular values and selectively updates singular vectors of network weights, thereby optimizing resource usage while closely approximating full-rank training. SST refines the training process by employing a targeted updating strategy for singular vectors, which is determined by a multinomial sampling method weighted by the significance of the singular values, ensuring both high performance and memory reduction. Through comprehensive testing on both Euclidean and hyperbolic neural networks across various tasks, including natural language generation, machine translation, node classification and link prediction, SST demonstrates its capability to outperform existing memory reduction training methods and is comparable with full-rank training in some cases. On OPT-125M, with rank equating to 8.3% of embedding dimension, SST reduces the perplexity gap to full-rank training by 67.6%, demonstrating a significant reduction of the performance loss with prevalent low-rank methods. This approach offers a strong alternative to traditional training techniques, paving the way for more efficient and scalable neural network training solutions.">

        <tr id="Recent work has suggested using Monte Carlo methods based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) to sample from target distributions of interest. PDMPs are non-reversible continuous-time processes endowed with momentum, and hence can mix better than standard reversible MCMC samplers. Furthermore, they can incorporate exact sub-sampling schemes which only require access to a single (randomly selected) data point at each iteration, yet without introducing bias to the algorithm's stationary distribution. However, the range of models for which PDMPs can be used, particularly with sub-sampling, is limited. We propose approximate simulation of PDMPs with sub-sampling for scalable sampling from posterior distributions. The approximation takes the form of an Euler approximation to the true PDMP dynamics, and involves using an estimate of the gradient of the log-posterior based on a data sub-sample. We thus call this class of algorithms stochastic-gradient PDMPs. Importantly, the trajectories of stochastic-gradient PDMPs are continuous and can leverage recent ideas for sampling from measures with continuous and atomic components. We show these methods are easy to implement, present results on their approximation error and demonstrate numerically that this class of algorithms has similar efficiency to, but is more robust than, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

        <tr id="This study proposes a novel long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for predicting future physical properties based on partial data of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It extracts latent vectors from atomic coordinates of MD simulations using graph convolutional network, utilizes LSTM to learn temporal trends in latent vectors and make one-step-ahead predictions of physical properties through fully connected layers. Validating with MD simulations of Ni solid-liquid systems, the model achieved accurate one-step-ahead prediction for time variation of the potential energy during solidification and melting processes using residual connections. Recursive use of predicted values enabled long-term prediction from just the first 20 snapshots of the MD simulation. The prediction has captured the feature of potential energy bending at low temperatures, which represents completion of solidification, despite that the MD data in short time do not have such a bending characteristic. Remarkably, for long-time prediction over 900 ps, the computation time was reduced to 1/700th of a full MD simulation of the same duration. This approach has shown the potential to significantly reduce computational cost for prediction of physical properties by efficiently utilizing the data of MD simulation.">

However, currently available neural network-based modeling approaches fall short when faced with data collected randomly over time and space, as is often the case with sensor networks in real-world applications like crowdsourced earthquake detection or pollution monitoring. In response, we developed a new spatiotemporal method that effectively handles such randomly sampled data. Our model integrates techniques from amortized variational inference, neural differential equations, neural point processes, and implicit neural representations to predict both the dynamics of the system and the probabilistic locations and timings of future observations. It outperforms existing methods on challenging spatiotemporal datasets by offering substantial improvements in predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a useful tool for modeling and understanding complex dynamical systems observed under realistic, unconstrained conditions.">

        <tr id="Symmetry is one of the most central concepts in physics, and it is no surprise that it has also been widely adopted as an inductive bias for machine-learning models applied to the physical sciences. This is especially true for models targeting the properties of matter at the atomic scale. Both established and state-of-the-art approaches, with almost no exceptions, are built to be exactly equivariant to translations, permutations, and rotations of the atoms. Incorporating symmetries -- rotations in particular -- constrains the model design space and implies more complicated architectures that are often also computationally demanding. There are indications that non-symmetric models can easily learn symmetries from data, and that doing so can even be beneficial for the accuracy of the model. We put a model that obeys rotational invariance only approximately to the test, in realistic scenarios involving simulations of gas-phase, liquid, and solid water. We focus specifically on physical observables that are likely to be affected -- directly or indirectly -- by symmetry breaking, finding negligible consequences when the model is used in an interpolative, bulk, regime. Even for extrapolative gas-phase predictions, the model remains very stable, even though symmetry artifacts are noticeable. We also discuss strategies that can be used to systematically reduce the magnitude of symmetry breaking when it occurs, and assess their impact on the convergence of observables.">

This work describes a data-driven technique to create high-fidelity low-dimensional models of flexible fiber dynamics using machine learning; the technique is applied to sedimentation in a quiescent, viscous Newtonian fluid, using results from detailed simulations as the data set. The approach combines an autoencoder neural network architecture to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the filament shape, with a neural ODE that learns the evolution of the particle in the latent state. The model was designed to model filaments of varying flexibility, characterized by an elasto-gravitational number $\mathcal{B}$, and was trained on a data set containing the evolution of fibers beginning at set angles of inclination. For the range of $\mathcal{B}$ considered here (100-10000), the filament shape dynamics can be represented with high accuracy with only four degrees of freedom, in contrast to the 93 present in the original bead-spring model used to generate the dynamic trajectories. We predict the evolution of fibers set at arbitrary angles and demonstrate that our data-driven model can accurately forecast the evolution of a fiber at both trained and untrained elasto-gravitational numbers.">

        <tr id="Despite innumerable efforts to characterize C. elegans neural activity and behavior, the roles of each individual neuron and the compositional mechanisms of all their interactions are still not completely known. In particular, there is evidence that C. elegans neurons perform changing roles over time, in different behavioral contexts, etc.; however, existing stationary anatomical and functional connectivity can average across time and obfuscate the nonstationary nature of the neural dynamics. We contribute to these efforts by leveraging recent advances in decomposed linear dynamical systems (dLDS) models. dLDS models neural dynamics in a latent space with a set of linear operators that can be recombined and reused over time, enabling the discovery of multiple parallel neural processes on different timescales. We leverage the ability to identify reused patterns of dynamical neural interactions, which we call “dynamical connectivity,” to 1) identify contextually dependent roles of neurons; 2) discover the underlying variability of neural representations even under discrete behaviors; 3) quantify differences between anatomical, functional, and dynamical connectivity; and 4) learn a single aligned latent space underlying multiple individual worms’ activity. These results highlight the importance of defining a neuron’s functions not solely by its internal activity or place in a time-averaged network, but by its evolving interactions across context-dependent circuits.">

Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor. These performances offer significant promise for data-driven scientific discovery and interpretation.">

The maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure is becoming increasingly costly, as a large number of structures is approaching the end of its design lifetime. Labor intensive manual inspection and assessment on a large scale is often infeasible, while data-driven machine learning techniques can fail to identify relevant failure mechanisms and suffer from poor generalization to previously unseen conditions, particularly when data is sparse. We propose a multi-task learning approach based on a physics-informed variational autoencoder that leverages a dictionary of physics-based models to improve the predictive performance when limited data is available. The latent space of the autoencoder is augmented with a set of physics-based latent variables that are interpretable and allow for prior knowledge on the latent variables to be included in the autoencoder formulation. To prevent the data-driven components of the encoder and decoder from overriding the known physics, a regularization method is used to impose physical constraints on the latent space and the generative model prediction. The feasibility of the proposed approach is evaluated on a case study of quay walls in Amsterdam, demonstrating improved performance over purely data-driven methods.

        <tr id="In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.">

We tackle this through the unifying framework of optimal transport, using theoretical insights and numerical algorithms to develop novel, high-performing RF couplings for kernels defined on Euclidean and discrete input spaces.

However, a sufficiently rigorous statement and theoretical proof of this heuristic is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we provide several novel contributions to the literature in this regard. Defining a new notion of nonlocal directional derivative, we analyze its theoretical properties (existence and convergence). Second, using a probabilistic reformulation, we show that nonlocal derivatives are epsilon-sub gradients, and derive sample complexity results for convergence of stochastic gradient descent-like methods using nonlocal derivatives. Finally, using our analysis of the nonlocal gradient of Holder continuous functions, we observe that sample paths of Brownian motion admit nonlocal directional derivatives, and the nonlocal derivatives of Brownian motion are seen to be Gaussian processes with computable mean and standard deviation. Using the theory of nonlocal directional derivatives, we solve a highly nondifferentiable and nonconvex model problem of parameter estimation on image articulation manifolds. Using Brownian motion infused ReLU activation functions with the nonlocal gradient in place of the usual gradient during backpropagation, we also perform experiments on multiple well-studied deep learning architectures. Our experiments indicate the superior generalization capabilities of Brownian neural activation functions in low-training data regimes, where the use of stochastic neurons beats the deterministic ReLU counterpart.">

We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries.

Here, hinging on ideas from group representation theory, we define trainable layers whose algebraic structure is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the lattice cell. Our method naturally allows for efficient implementations, both in terms of memory usage and computational costs, supporting scalable training/testing for lattices in two spatial dimensions and higher, as the size of symmetry group grows. We validate and test our approach considering 2D and 3D flowing dynamics, both in laminar and turbulent regimes. We compare with group averaged-based symmetric networks and with plain, non-symmetric, networks, showing how our approach unlocks the (a-posteriori) accuracy and training stability of the former models, and the train/inference speed of the latter networks (LENNs are about one order of magnitude faster than group-averaged networks in 3D).

We develop a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves the likelihood, decoding, and parameter learning problems for tree-based HMMs with coupled branches. Our approach scales polynomially with the number of states and nodes, making it computationally feasible for a wide range of applications and does not suffer from the underflow problem. We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to simulated data and propose self-consistency checks for validating the assumptions of the model used for inference.

        <tr id="We present the hidden-layer concatenated physics informed neural network (HLConcPINN) method, which combines hidden-layer concatenated feed-forward neural networks, a modified block time marching strategy, and a physics informed approach for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). We analyze the convergence properties and establish the error bounds of this method for two types of PDEs: parabolic (exemplified by the heat and Burgers' equations) and hyperbolic (exemplified by the wave and nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations). We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.">

While these operators perform effectively in either the time or frequency domain, their performance may be limited when applied to non-stationary spatial or temporal signals whose frequency characteristics change with time. Here, we introduce Complex Neural Operator (CoNO) that parameterizes the integral kernel using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), better representing non-stationary signals in a complex-valued domain. Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

        <tr id="The generative modeling of data on manifold is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates to a new momentum variable that stays in a simple $\textbf{fixed vector space}$. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets. We also, arguably for the first time, tackle the generation of data on high-dimensional Special Orthogonal and Unitary groups, the latter essential for quantum problems.">

However, exploring the conformational space, especially for large systems with slow transitions, often requires enhanced sampling methods. Although conducting MD at high temperatures provides a straightforward approach, resulting conformational ensembles diverge significantly from those at low temperatures. To address this discrepancy, we propose a novel probability density-based reweighting (PDR) method. PDR exhibits robust performance across four distinct systems, including a miniprotein, a cyclic peptide, a protein loop, and a protein-peptide complex. It accurately restores the conformational distributions at high temperatures to those at low temperatures. Additionally, we apply PDR to reweight previously studied high-T MD simulations of 12 protein-peptide complexes, enabling a comprehensive investigation of the conformational space of protein-peptide complexes.">

        <tr id="Transformer-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse domains, becoming the state-of-the-art solution for addressing sequential machine learning problems. Even though we have a general understanding of the fundamental components in the transformer architecture, little is known about how they operate or what are their expected dynamics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between attention mechanisms and Hopfield networks, promising to shed light on the statistical physics of transformer networks. However, to date, the dynamical regimes of transformer-like models have not been studied in depth. In this paper, we address this gap by using methods for the study of asymmetric Hopfield networks in nonequilibrium regimes --namely path integral methods over generating functionals, yielding dynamics governed by concurrent mean-field variables. Assuming 1-bit tokens and weights, we derive analytical approximations for the behavior of large self-attention neural networks coupled to a softmax output, which become exact in the large limit size. Our findings reveal nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions associated with chaotic bifurcations, even for very simple configurations with a few encoded features and a very short context window. Finally, we discuss the potential of our analytic approach to improve our understanding of the inner workings of transformer models, potentially reducing computational training costs and enhancing model interpretability.">

        <tr id="One of the key challenges of k-means clustering is the seed selection or the initial centroid estimation since the clustering result depends heavily on this choice. Alternatives such as k-means++ have mitigated this limitation by estimating the centroids using an empirical probability distribution. However, with high-dimensional and complex data sets such as those obtained from molecular simulation, k-means++ fails to partition the data in an optimal manner. Furthermore, stochastic elements in all flavors of k-means++ will lead to a lack of reproducibility. K-means N-Ary Natural Initiation (NANI) is presented as an alternative to tackle this challenge by using efficient n-ary comparisons to both identify high-density regions in the data and select a diverse set of initial conformations. Centroids generated from NANI are not only representative of the data and different from one another, helping k-means to partition the data accurately, but also deterministic, providing consistent cluster populations across replicates. From peptide and protein folding molecular simulations, NANI was able to create compact and well-separated clusters as well as accurately find the metastable states that agree with the literature. NANI can cluster diverse data sets and be used as a standalone tool or as part of our MDANCE clustering package.">

This theory provides universal, exact relations for quantities like work, which have been verified in experiments where a fully resolved description allows direct access to such quantities. Complementary studies consider partially hidden, coarse-grained descriptions, in which the mean entropy production typically is not directly accessible but can be bounded in terms of observable quantities. Going beyond the mean, we introduce a fluctuating entropy production that applies to individual trajectories in a coarse-grained description under time-dependent driving. Thus, this concept is applicable to the broad and experimentally significant class of driven systems in which not all relevant states can be resolved. We provide a paradigmatic example by studying an experimentally verified protein unfolding process. As a consequence, the entire distribution of the coarse-grained entropy production rather than merely its mean retains spatial and temporal information about the microscopic process. In particular, we obtain a bound on the distribution of the physical entropy production of individual unfolding events.">

Compared to other machine learning methods that provide time series prediction, such as transformers, our approach is suitable for setups where the interpolation and extrapolation regions are general subdomains and, in particular, manifolds. In addition, our construction leads to an improved loss function that helps us boost the accuracy and robustness of our neural network.

Towards this goal, we develop DeepConformer, a diffusion generative model for sampling protein conformation distributions from a given amino acid sequence. Despite the lack of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data in training process, DeepConformer captured conformational flexibility and dynamics (RMSF and covariance matrix correlation) similar to MD simulation and reproduced experimentally observed conformational variations.

Recently, randomized symplectic methods such as the randomized complex singular value decomposition (rcSVD) have been developed for a more efficient computation of symplectic bases that preserve the Hamiltonian structure during MOR. In the current paper, we present two error bounds for the rcSVD basis depending on the choice of hyperparameters and show that with a proper choice of hyperparameters, the projection error of rcSVD is at most a constant factor worse than the projection error of cSVD.

Proper folding is essential for proteins to acquire their functional three-dimensional structures and execute their biological role, whereas misfolded proteins can lead to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Therefore, a deeper understanding of protein folding is vital for understanding disease mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies. This study introduces the Stochastic Landscape Classification (SLC), an innovative, automated, nonlearning algorithm that quantitatively analyzes protein folding dynamics. Focusing on collective variables (CVs) - low-dimensional representations of complex dynamical systems like molecular dynamics (MD) of macromolecules - the SLC approach segments the CVs into distinct macrostates, revealing the protein folding pathway explored by MD simulations. The segmentation is achieved by analyzing changes in CV trends and clustering these segments using a standard density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) scheme. Applied to the MD-based CV trajectories of Chignolin and Trp-Cage proteins, the SLC demonstrates apposite accuracy, validated by comparing standard classification metrics against ground-truth data. These metrics affirm the efficacy of the SLC in capturing intricate protein dynamics and offer a method to evaluate and select the most informative CVs. The practical application of this technique lies in its ability to provide a detailed, quantitative description of protein folding processes, with significant implications for understanding and manipulating protein behavior in industrial and pharmaceutical contexts.">

        <tr id="Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) is a latent variable modeling technique commonly used to identify smooth, low-dimensional latent trajectories underlying high-dimensional neural recordings. Specifically, researchers model spiking rates as Gaussian observations, resulting in tractable inference. Recently, GPFA has been extended to model spike count data. However, due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood, the inference becomes intractable. Prior works rely on either black-box inference techniques, numerical integration or polynomial approximations of the likelihood to handle intractability. To overcome this challenge, we propose a conditionally-conjugate Gaussian process factor analysis (ccGPFA) resulting in both analytically and computationally tractable inference for modeling neural activity from spike count data. In particular, we develop a novel data augmentation based method that renders the model conditionally conjugate. Consequently, our model enjoys the advantage of simple closed-form updates using a variational EM algorithm. Furthermore, due to its conditional conjugacy, we show our model can be readily scaled using sparse Gaussian Processes and accelerated inference via natural gradients. To validate our method, we empirically demonstrate its efficacy through experiments.">

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

        <tr id="There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.">

JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals.

The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.">

Common examples include accounting for velocity fluctuations in a turbulent fluid flow model and cloud evolution in climate models. Most existing techniques for constructing coarse-grained models feature ill-defined parameters whose values are arbitrarily chosen (e.g., a window size), are narrow in their applicability (e.g., only applicable to time series or spatial data), or cannot readily incorporate physics information. Here, we introduce the concept of physics-guided Gaussian process regression as a machine-learning-based coarse-graining technique that is broadly applicable and amenable to input from known physics-based relationships. Using a pair of case studies derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the attractive properties and superior performance of physics-guided Gaussian processes for coarse-graining relative to prevalent benchmarks. The key advantage of Gaussian-process-based coarse-graining is its ability to seamlessly integrate data-driven and physics-based information.">

        <tr id="Equations of State model relations between thermodynamic variables and are ubiquitous in scientific modelling, appearing in modern day applications ranging from Astrophysics to Climate Science. The three desired properties of a general Equation of State model are adherence to the Laws of Thermodynamics, incorporation of phase transitions, and multiscale accuracy. Analytic models that adhere to all three are hard to develop and cumbersome to work with, often resulting in sacrificing one of these elements for the sake of efficiency. In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions. They can be used either"from scratch"to learn a full Equation of State, or in conjunction with a pre-existing consistent model, functioning as a modification that better adheres to experimental data. We formulate the theory and provide several computational examples to justify both approaches, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings.">

        <tr id="We propose a novel reduced-order methodology to describe complex multi-frequency fluid dynamics from time-resolved snapshot data. Starting point is the Cluster-based Network Model (CNM) thanks to its fully automatable development and human interpretability. Our key innovation is to model the transitions from cluster to cluster much more accurately by replacing snapshot states with short-term trajectories ("orbits") over multiple clusters, thus avoiding nonphysical intra-cluster diffusion in the dynamic reconstruction. The proposed orbital CNM (oCNM) employs functional clustering to coarse-grain the short-term trajectories. Specifically, different filtering techniques, resulting in different temporal basis expansions, demonstrate the versatility and capability of the oCNM to adapt to diverse flow phenomena. The oCNM is illustrated on the Stuart-Landau oscillator and its post-transient solution with time-varying parameters to test its ability to capture the amplitude selection mechanism and multi-frequency behaviours. Then, the oCNM is applied to the fluidic pinball across varying flow regimes at different Reynolds numbers, including the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. This orbital-focused perspective enhances the understanding of complex temporal behaviours by incorporating high-frequency behaviour into the kinematics of short-time trajectories while modelling the dynamics of the lower frequencies. In analogy to Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which marked the transition from spatial-only modes to spatio-temporal ones, this work advances from analysing temporal local states to examining piecewise short-term trajectories, or orbits. By merging advanced analytical methods, such as the functional representation of short-time trajectories with CNM, this study paves the way for new approaches to dissect the complex dynamics characterising turbulent systems.">

The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through comparative analysis with the long-distance equivariant (LODE) descriptor. In a toy model with purely electrostatic interactions, our model achieves errors below 0.1%. The application of our descriptors, in combination with local descriptors representing the atomic density, to materials where monopole-monopole interactions are important such as sodium chloride successfully captures long-range interactions, improving predictive accuracy.

These processes are highly nonlinear, stochastic, and sensitive to small perturbations of system parameters and initial conditions. Methods for the simulation of these processes have been developed using discrete numerical models, but these are computationally expensive. This work aims to scale crystal growth simulation with a machine learning emulator. Specifically, autoregressive latent variable models are well suited for modeling the joint distribution over system parameters and the crystallization trajectories. However, successfully training such models is challenging due to the stochasticity and sensitivity of the system. Existing approaches consequently fail to produce diverse and faithful crystallization trajectories. In this paper, we introduce the Crystal Growth Neural Emulator (CGNE), a probabilistic model for efficient crystal growth emulation at the mesoscopic scale that overcomes these challenges. We validate CGNE results using the morphological properties of the crystals produced by numerical simulation. CGNE delivers a factor of 11 improvement in inference time and performance gains compared with recent state-of-the-art probabilistic models for dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="De-interleaving of the mixtures of Hidden Markov Processes (HMPs) generally depends on its representation model. Existing representation models consider Markov chain mixtures rather than hidden Markov, resulting in the lack of robustness to non-ideal situations such as observation noise or missing observations. Besides, de-interleaving methods utilize a search-based strategy, which is time-consuming. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel representation model and corresponding de-interleaving methods for the mixtures of HMPs. At first, a generative model for representing the mixtures of HMPs is designed. Subsequently, the de-interleaving process is formulated as a posterior inference for the generative model. Secondly, an exact inference method is developed to maximize the likelihood of the complete data, and two approximate inference methods are developed to maximize the evidence lower bound by creating tractable structures. Then, a theoretical error probability lower bound is derived using the likelihood ratio test, and the algorithms are shown to get reasonably close to the bound. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are highly effective and robust for non-ideal situations, outperforming baseline methods on simulated and real-life data.">

The success of state-of-the-art models stems from their ability to incorporate physical symmetries, such as translation, rotation, and periodicity. Here, we present a novel generative method called Response Matching (RM), which leverages the fact that each stable material or molecule exists at the minimum of its potential energy surface. Consequently, any perturbation induces a response in energy and stress, driving the structure back to equilibrium. Matching to such response is closely related to score matching in diffusion models. By employing the combination of a machine learning interatomic potential and random structure search as the denoising model, RM exploits the locality of atomic interactions, and inherently respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. RM is the first model to handle both molecules and bulk materials under the same framework. We demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of RM across three systems: a small organic molecular dataset, stable crystals from the Materials Project, and one-shot learning on a single diamond configuration.">

        <tr id="The joint prediction of continuous fields and statistical estimation of the underlying discrete parameters is a common problem for many physical systems, governed by PDEs. Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.">

A key qualitative feature of the dynamics is the existence of a perfect interpolator of the data, irrespective of the sample size. In both scenarios, we provide precise, non-asymptotic rates of convergence to the (possibly degenerate) stationary distribution.

        <tr id="Computing free energy differences between metastable states characterized by nonoverlapping Boltzmann distributions is often a computationally intensive endeavor, usually requiring chains of intermediate states to connect them. Targeted free energy perturbation (TFEP) can significantly lower the computational cost of FEP calculations by choosing a set of invertible maps used to directly connect the distributions of interest, achieving the necessary statistically significant overlaps without sampling any intermediate states. Probabilistic generative models (PGMs) based on normalizing flow architectures can make it much easier via machine learning to train invertible maps needed for TFEP. However, the accuracy and applicability of approaches based on empirically learned maps depend crucially on the choice of reweighting method adopted to estimate the free energy differences. In this work, we assess the accuracy, rate of convergence, and data efficiency of different free energy estimators, including exponential averaging, Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), and multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR), in reweighting PGMs trained by maximum likelihood on limited amounts of molecular dynamics data sampled only from end-states of interest. We carry out the comparisons on a set of simple but representative case studies, including conformational ensembles of alanine dipeptide and ibuprofen. Our results indicate that BAR and MBAR are both data efficient and robust, even in the presence of significant model overfitting in the generation of invertible maps. This analysis can serve as a stepping stone for the deployment of efficient and quantitatively accurate ML-based free energy calculation methods in complex systems.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed deep learning has been developed as a novel paradigm for learning physical dynamics recently. While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="The Langevin Dynamics framework, which aims to generate samples from the score function of a probability distribution, is widely used for analyzing and interpreting score-based generative modeling. While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose Chained Langevin Dynamics, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics.

One of the main criticisms to machine learned potentials is that the energy inferred by the network is not as interpretable as in more traditional approaches where a simpler functional form is used. Here we address this problem by extending tools recently proposed in the nascent field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to coarse-grained potentials based on graph neural networks (GNN). We demonstrate the approach on three different coarse-grained systems including two fluids (methane and water) and the protein NTL9. On these examples, we show that the neural network potentials can be in practice decomposed in relevance contributions to different orders, that can be directly interpreted and provide physical insights on the systems of interest.">

Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.">

        <tr id="Data-driven, machine learning (ML) models of atomistic interactions are often based on flexible and non-physical functions that can relate nuanced aspects of atomic arrangements into predictions of energies and forces. As a result, these potentials are as good as the training data (usually results of so-called ab initio simulations) and we need to make sure that we have enough information for a model to become sufficiently accurate, reliable and transferable. The main challenge stems from the fact that descriptors of chemical environments are often sparse high-dimensional objects without a well-defined continuous metric. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that any ad hoc method of choosing training examples will be indiscriminate, and it will be easy to fall into the trap of confirmation bias, where the same narrow and biased sampling is used to generate train- and test- sets. We will demonstrate that classical concepts of statistical planning of experiments and optimal design can help to mitigate such problems at a relatively low computational cost. The key feature of the method we will investigate is that they allow us to assess the informativeness of data (how much we can improve the model by adding/swapping a training example) and verify if the training is feasible with the current set before obtaining any reference energies and forces -- a so-called off-line approach. In other words, we are focusing on an approach that is easy to implement and doesn't require sophisticated frameworks that involve automated access to high-performance computational (HPC).">

Such networks have a variety of hallmark properties: the outputs depend on the inputs via compressive nonlinearities such as cubic roots, and both the timescales of relaxation and the length-scales of signal propagation depend sensitively on the inputs as power laws, both diverging as the input to 0. The basic dynamical mechanism is that inputs to the network generate ongoing activity, which in turn controls how additional inputs or signals propagate spatially or attenuate in time. We present analytical solutions for the steady states when the network is forced with a single oscillation and when a background value creates a steady state of ongoing activity, and derive the relationships shaping the value of the temporal decay and spatial propagation length as a function of this background value.">

        <tr id="We consider the problem of learning the dynamics in the topology of time-evolving point clouds, the prevalent spatiotemporal model for systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as swarms of insects and birds or particles in physics. In such systems, patterns emerge from (local) interactions among self-propelled entities. While several well-understood governing equations for motion and interaction exist, they are difficult to fit to data due to the often large number of entities and missing correspondences between the observation times, which may also not be equidistant. To evade such confounding factors, we investigate collective behavior from a \textit{topological perspective}, but instead of summarizing entire observation sequences (as in prior work), we propose learning a latent dynamical model from topological features \textit{per time point}. The latter is then used to formulate a downstream regression task to predict the parametrization of some a priori specified governing equation. We implement this idea based on a latent ODE learned from vectorized (static) persistence diagrams and show that this modeling choice is justified by a combination of recent stability results for persistent homology. Various (ablation) experiments not only demonstrate the relevance of each individual model component, but provide compelling empirical evidence that our proposed model -- \textit{neural persistence dynamics} -- substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art across a diverse set of parameter regression tasks.">

The compressed data may also lack interpretability thus making it difficult to identify feature patterns from the original data. To address this issue, we present an online randomized algorithm to compute the interpolative decomposition (ID) of large-scale data matrices in situ. Compared to previous randomized IDs that used the QR decomposition to determine the column basis, we adopt a streaming ridge leverage score-based column subset selection algorithm that dynamically selects proper basis columns from the data and thus avoids an extra pass over the data to compute the coefficient matrix of the ID. In particular, we adopt a single-pass error estimator based on the non-adaptive Hutch++ algorithm to provide real-time error approximation for determining the best coefficients. As a result, our approach only needs a single pass over the original data and thus is suitable for large and high-dimensional matrices stored outside of core memory or generated in PDE simulations. We also provide numerical experiments on turbulent channel flow and ignition simulations, and on the NSTX Gas Puff Image dataset, comparing our algorithm with the offline ID algorithm to demonstrate its utility in real-world applications.">

        <tr id="Active learning optimizes the exploration of large parameter spaces by strategically selecting which experiments or simulations to conduct, thus reducing resource consumption and potentially accelerating scientific discovery. A key component of this approach is a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), which approximates an unknown functional relationship between control parameters and a target property. However, conventional GPs often struggle when applied to systems with discontinuities and non-stationarities, prompting the exploration of alternative models. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in physical science problems, which are often characterized by abrupt transitions between different system states and rapid changes in physical property behavior. Fully Bayesian Neural Networks (FBNNs) serve as a promising substitute, treating all neural network weights probabilistically and leveraging advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for direct sampling from the posterior distribution. This approach enables FBNNs to provide reliable predictive distributions, crucial for making informed decisions under uncertainty in the active learning setting. Although traditionally considered too computationally expensive for 'big data' applications, many physical sciences problems involve small amounts of data in relatively low-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we assess the suitability and performance of FBNNs with the No-U-Turn Sampler for active learning tasks in the 'small data' regime, highlighting their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and reliability on test functions relevant to problems in physical sciences.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data.

These characteristics suggest a depth of expressivity that underscores their potential for advanced computational applications. However, strategies to effectively exploit chaotic dynamics for information processing have largely remained elusive. In this study, we reveal that the essence of chaos can be found in various state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Drawing inspiration from this revelation, we propose a novel method that directly leverages chaotic dynamics for deep learning architectures. Our approach is systematically evaluated across distinct chaotic systems. In all instances, our framework presents superior results to conventional deep neural networks in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and efficiency. Furthermore, we found an active role of transient chaos formation in our scheme. Collectively, this study offers a new path for the integration of chaos, which has long been overlooked in information processing, and provides insights into the prospective fusion of chaotic dynamics within the domains of machine learning and neuromorphic computation.">

However, ensuring stability and efficiency remains a challenge, especially in scenarios involving nonlinear and time-dependent equations. Methodology: This paper introduces novel residual-based architectures, namely the Simple Highway Network and the Squared Residual Network, designed to enhance stability and accuracy in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). These architectures augment traditional neural networks by incorporating residual connections, which facilitate smoother weight updates and improve backpropagation efficiency. Results: Through extensive numerical experiments across various examples including linear and nonlinear, time-dependent and independent PDEs we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architectures. The Squared Residual Network, in particular, exhibits robust performance, achieving enhanced stability and accuracy compared to conventional neural networks. These findings underscore the potential of residual-based architectures in advancing deep learning for PDEs and computational physics applications.">

We test our approach by training a single cDDPM to perform multidimensional particle-wise unfolding for a variety of physics processes, including those not seen during training.

Here, we investigate the training dynamics of two-layer shallow neural networks trained with gradient-based algorithms, and discuss how they learn pertinent features in multi-index models, that is target functions with low-dimensional relevant directions. In the high-dimensional regime, where the input dimension $d$ diverges, we show that a simple modification of the idealized single-pass gradient descent training scenario, where data can now be repeated or iterated upon twice, drastically improves its computational efficiency. In particular, it surpasses the limitations previously believed to be dictated by the Information and Leap exponents associated with the target function to be learned. Our results highlight the ability of networks to learn relevant structures from data alone without any pre-processing. More precisely, we show that (almost) all directions are learned with at most $O(d \log d)$ steps. Among the exceptions is a set of hard functions that includes sparse parities. In the presence of coupling between directions, however, these can be learned sequentially through a hierarchical mechanism that generalizes the notion of staircase functions. Our results are proven by a rigorous study of the evolution of the relevant statistics for high-dimensional dynamics.">

        <tr id="Modeling the dynamics of flexible objects has become an emerging topic in the community as these objects become more present in many applications, e.g., soft robotics. Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

Accurately locating them is critical not just for deeper understanding of observed dynamic behavior, but also for designing efficient interventions. When the dynamical system at hand is complex, possibly noisy, and expensive to sample, standard (e.g. continuation based) numerical methods may become impractical. We propose an active learning framework, where Bayesian Optimization is leveraged to discover saddle-node or Hopf bifurcations, from a judiciously chosen small number of vector field observations. Such an approach becomes especially attractive in systems whose state x parameter space exploration is resource-limited. It also naturally provides a framework for uncertainty quantification (aleatoric and epistemic), useful in systems with inherent stochasticity.">

However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

        <tr id="Physics-guided neural networks (PGNN) is an effective tool that combines the benefits of data-driven modeling with the interpretability and generalization of underlying physical information. However, for a classical PGNN, the penalization of the physics-guided part is at the output level, which leads to a conservative result as systems with highly similar state-transition functions, i.e. only slight differences in parameters, can have significantly different time-series outputs. Furthermore, the classical PGNN cost function regularizes the model estimate over the entire state space with a constant trade-off hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce a novel model augmentation strategy for nonlinear state-space model identification based on PGNN, using a weighted function regularization (W-PGNN). The proposed approach can efficiently augment the prior physics-based state-space models based on measurement data. A new weighted regularization term is added to the cost function to penalize the difference between the state and output function of the baseline physics-based and final identified model. This ensures the estimated model follows the baseline physics model functions in regions where the data has low information content, while placing greater trust in the data when a high informativity is present. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy over the current PGNN method is demonstrated on a benchmark example.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.">

        <tr id="Langevin Dynamics is a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) central to sampling and generative modeling and is implemented via time discretization. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.">

Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

The package is based on an embedding scheme that uses a physics-based model of the electronic density and induction with a handful of tunable parameters derived from in vacuo properties of the subsystem to be embedded. This scheme is completely independent of the in vacuo potential and requires only the positions of the atoms of the machine learning subsystem and the positions and partial charges of the molecular mechanics environment. These characteristics allow emle-engine to be employed in existing QM/MM software. We demonstrate that the implemented electrostatic machine learning embedding scheme (named EMLE) is stable in enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. Through the calculation of free energy surfaces of alanine dipeptide in water with two different ML options for the in vacuo potential and three embedding models, we test the performance of EMLE. When compared to the reference DFT/MM surface, the EMLE embedding is clearly superior to the MM one based on fixed partial charges. The configurational dependence of the electronic density and the inclusion of the induction energy introduced by the EMLE model leads to a systematic reduction in the average error of the free energy surface when compared to MM embedding. By enabling the usage of EMLE embedding in practical ML/MM simulations, emle-engine will make it possible to accurately model systems and processes that feature significant variations in the charge distribution of the ML subsystem and/or the interacting environment.">

The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, for all time steps within the stability criteria correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions.

This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).">

        <tr id="Elucidating the intricate relationship between the structure and dynamics in the context of the glass transition has been a persistent challenge. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal tool, offering novel pathways to predict dynamic behaviors from structural descriptors. Notably, recent research has highlighted that the distance between the initial particle positions between the equilibrium positions substantially enhances the prediction of glassy dynamics. However, these methodologies have been limited in their ability to capture the directional aspects of these deviations from the equilibrium positions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the complex particle interactions within the cage dynamics. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel structural parameter: the vectorial displacement of particles from their initial configuration to their equilibrium positions. Recognizing the inadequacy of current ML models in effectively handling such vectorial parameters, we have developed an Equivariance-Constrained Invariant Graph Neural Network (EIGNN). This innovative model not only bolsters the descriptive capacity of conventional rotation-invariant models but also streamlines the computational demands associated with rotation-equivariant graph neural networks. Our rigorous experimental validation on 3D glassy system from GlassBench dataset has yielded compelling evidence that the EIGNN model significantly enhance the correlation between structural representation and dynamic properties.">

        <tr id="We investigate the learning of implicit neural representation (INR) using an overparameterized multilayer perceptron (MLP) via a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. The latter offers an efficient example selection framework for teaching nonparametrically defined (viz. non-closed-form) target functions, such as image functions defined by 2D grids of pixels. To address the costly training of INRs, we propose a paradigm called Implicit Neural Teaching (INT) that treats INR learning as a nonparametric teaching problem, where the given signal being fitted serves as the target function. The teacher then selects signal fragments for iterative training of the MLP to achieve fast convergence. By establishing a connection between MLP evolution through parameter-based gradient descent and that of function evolution through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching an overparameterized MLP is consistent with teaching a nonparametric learner. This new discovery readily permits a convenient drop-in of nonparametric teaching algorithms to broadly enhance INR training efficiency, demonstrating 30%+ training time savings across various input modalities.">

We then investigate in detail two adaptive learning rates -- an idealized exact line search and AdaGrad-Norm -- on the least squares problem. When the data covariance matrix has strictly positive eigenvalues, this idealized exact line search strategy can exhibit arbitrarily slower convergence when compared to the optimal fixed learning rate with SGD. Moreover we exactly characterize the limiting learning rate (as time goes to infinity) for line search in the setting where the data covariance has only two distinct eigenvalues. For noiseless targets, we further demonstrate that the AdaGrad-Norm learning rate converges to a deterministic constant inversely proportional to the average eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix, and identify a phase transition when the covariance density of eigenvalues follows a power law distribution.">

Each component of MSSMs is associated with each cluster. An advantage of the proposed method is that it enables the use of time series models appropriate to the specific time series. This not only improves clustering and prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of the estimated parameters. The parameters of the MSSMs are estimated using stochastic variational inference, a subtype of variational inference. The proposed method estimates the latent variables of an arbitrary state space model by using neural networks with a normalizing flow as a variational estimator. The number of clusters can be estimated using the Bayesian information criterion. In addition, to prevent MSSMs from converging to the local optimum, we propose several optimization tricks, including an additional penalty term called entropy annealing. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the proposed method is effective for clustering, parameter estimation, and estimating the number of clusters.">

However, existing methods only allow researchers to infer latent variables that explain subjects' behavior in a relatively small class of cognitive models. For example, a broad class of relevant cognitive models with analytically intractable likelihood is currently out of reach from standard techniques, based on Maximum a Posteriori parameter estimation. Here, we present an approach that extends neural Bayes estimation to learn a direct mapping between experimental data and the targeted latent variable space using recurrent neural networks and simulated datasets. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance in inferring latent variable sequences in both tractable and intractable models. Furthermore, the approach is generalizable across different computational models and is adaptable for both continuous and discrete latent spaces. We then demonstrate its applicability in real world datasets. Our work underscores that combining recurrent neural networks and simulation-based inference to identify latent variable sequences can enable researchers to access a wider class of cognitive models for model-based neural analyses, and thus test a broader set of theories.">

Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.">

        <tr id="Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.">

However, conventional BNNs often suffer from high computational complexity and parameter overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed Probabilistic BNN (ProbBNN), which leverages probabilistic computing principles to streamline the inference process. Unlike traditional deterministic approaches, ProbBNN represents inputs and parameters as random variables governed by probability distributions, allowing for the propagation of uncertainty throughout the network. We employ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to represent the parameters of each neuron or convolutional kernel, enabling efficient encoding and processing of uncertainty. Our approach simplifies the inference process by replacing complex deterministic computations with lightweight probabilistic operations, resulting in reduced computational complexity and improved scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbBNN in achieving competitive accuracy to traditional BNNs while significantly reducing the number of parameters. The transition to ProbBNN yields a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the number of parameters compared to baseline approaches, making our approach promising for deployment in resource-constrained applications such as edge computing and IoT devices.">

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

In this paper, we offer a solution of this problem by using a variational Bayes framework, where the uncertainty over the delays is marginalized in order to obtain conservative coupling estimates. To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI. In our ground-truth experiments, we show that the network provides reliable and conservative estimates of the couplings, greatly outperforming similar methods such as regression DCM.">

The key idea is to estimate of a collection of simple local models as opposed to a single and complex regression model trained in the entire input space. We use principles from the Online Deterministic Annealing (ODA) optimization framework to construct an adaptive partition of the input space, which enables the introduction of local function approximation models within each subset of the partition. We show that both the partitioning and the local model training algorithms are stochastic approximation algorithms that operate online, and with the same observations, as part of a two-timescale stochastic approximation scheme. This process constitutes a heuristic method to gradually increase the complexity of the function approximation framework in a task-agnostic manner, giving emphasis to regions of the input space where the regression error is high. As a result this framework has inherent explainability properties, and is suitable for continuous learning applications where regression improvement without retraining from scratch is crucial.

        <tr id="Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.">

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

        <tr id="We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional score-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics involving the inference of a specimen's spatially varying material properties from noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional score-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate the score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint distribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple realizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network, the so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior distribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on Langevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the forward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward models and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been trained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different realizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that involve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements. Some examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data collected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement modalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and non-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results show that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse problems efficiently.">

In this work, we consider iterative methods, which use iterative linear system solvers to approximate marginal likelihood gradients up to a specified numerical precision, allowing a trade-off between compute time and accuracy of a solution. We introduce a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, and identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations. We then propose to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a $\textit{warm start}$. Finally, we discuss the necessary conditions and quantify the consequences of warm starts and demonstrate their effectiveness on regression tasks, where warm starts achieve the same results as the conventional procedure while providing up to a $16 \times$ average speed-up among datasets.">

This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides some perspectives on why the time and variance schedule used in [Karras et al. 2022] could be better tuned than the pioneering version in [Song et al. 2020].">

Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep recurrent neural networks. Alternative, when using a reservoir computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning when using a reservoir computing approach. In this paper, we focus on the reservoir computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to echo state networks and gated recurrent units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ and up to $87.90\%$ in contrast to echo state networks and gated recurrent units respectively. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to existing approaches.">

These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenomena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries. With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training.">

Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

The recently released version of the Martini CG force field (Martini 3) has been successfully applied to simulate many processes, including protein-ligand binding. However, the current ligand parametrization scheme is manual and requires an a priori reference all-atom (AA) simulation for benchmarking. For systems with suboptimal AA parameters, which are often unknown, this translates into a CG model that does not reproduce the true dynamical behavior of the underlying molecule. Here, we present Bartender, a quantum mechanics (QM)/MD-based parametrization tool written in Go. Bartender harnesses the power of QM simulations and produces reasonable bonded terms for Martini 3 CG models of small molecules in an efficient and user-friendly manner. For small, ring-like molecules, Bartender generates models whose properties are indistinguishable from the human-made models. For more complex, drug-like ligands, it is able to fit functional forms beyond simple harmonic dihedrals and thus better captures their dynamical behavior. Bartender has the power to both increase the efficiency and the accuracy of Martini 3-based high-throughput applications by producing numerically stable and physically realistic CG models.">

Machine learned potentials (MLPs) show great promise as more accurate alternatives to empirical forcefields, but are not readily decomposed into physically motivated functional forms, which has thus far rendered them incompatible with standard alchemical free energy methods that manipulate individual pairwise interaction terms. However, since the accuracy of free energy calculations is highly sensitive to the forcefield, this is a key area in which MLPs have the potential to address the shortcomings of empirical forcefields. In this work, we introduce an efficient alchemical free energy method compatible with MLPs, enabling, for the first time, calculations of biomolecular free energy with \textit{ab initio} accuracy. Using a pretrained, transferrable, alchemically equipped MACE model, we demonstrate sub-chemical accuracy for the hydration free energies of organic molecules.">

Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates.

The slow sampling speed is also a main obstacle to its wide application. To address the challenges, we propose Deep Data Consistency (DDC) to update the data consistency step with a deep learning model when solving inverse problems with diffusion models. By analyzing existing methods, the variational bound training objective is used to maximize the conditional posterior and reduce its impact on the diffusion process. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods in linear and non-linear tasks, DDC demonstrates its outstanding performance of both similarity and realness metrics in generating high-quality solutions with only 5 inference steps in 0.77 seconds on average. In addition, the robustness of DDC is well illustrated in the experiments across datasets, with large noise and the capacity to solve multiple tasks in only one pre-trained model.">

        <tr id="With the rapid advancement of graphical processing units, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are emerging as a promising tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs are not well suited for solving PDEs with multiscale features, particularly suffering from slow convergence and poor accuracy. To address this limitation of PINNs, this article proposes physics-informed cell representations for resolving multiscale Poisson problems using a model architecture consisting of multilevel multiresolution grids coupled with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The grid parameters (i.e., the level-dependent feature vectors) and the MLP parameters (i.e., the weights and biases) are determined using gradient-descent based optimization. The variational (weak) form based loss function accelerates computation by allowing the linear interpolation of feature vectors within grid cells. This cell-based MLP model also facilitates the use of a decoupled training scheme for Dirichlet boundary conditions and a parameter-sharing scheme for periodic boundary conditions, delivering superior accuracy compared to conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the numerical examples highlight improved speed and accuracy in solving PDEs with nonlinear or high-frequency boundary conditions and provide insights into hyperparameter selection. In essence, by cell-based MLP model along with the parallel tiny-cuda-nn library, our implementation improves convergence speed and numerical accuracy.">

        <tr id="Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.">

We are able to understand the role played by activation functions in separability. Indeed, we show that all non-polynomial activations, such as ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in terms of expressivity, and that they reach maximum discrimination capacity. We demonstrate how assessing the separation power of an equivariant neural network can be simplified to evaluating the separation power of minimal representations.

Recently, local structural variables identified using machine learning, such as"softness", have emerged as predictors of local dynamics. Here we construct a model using softness to describe the structural origins of dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquids. In our model, the probability of particles to rearrange is determined by their softness, and each rearrangement induces changes in the softness of nearby particles, describing facilitation. We show how to ensure that these changes respect the underlying time-reversal symmetry of the liquid's dynamics. The model reproduces the salient features of dynamical heterogeneity, and demonstrates how long-ranged dynamical correlations can emerge at long time scales from a relatively short softness correlation length.">

To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

The approximate nonadiabatic dynamics methods investigated include mixed quantum-classical Ehrenfest mean-field and fewest-switches surface hopping, linearized semiclassical mapping dynamics, symmetrized quasiclassical dynamics, the spin-mapping method, and extended classical mapping models. Different model systems were evaluated, including the spin-boson model for nonadiabatic dynamics in the condensed phase, the linear vibronic coupling model for electronic transition through conical intersections, the photoisomerization model of retinal, and Tully's one-dimensional scattering models. Our calculations show that the optimal choice of approximate dynamical method is system-specific, and the accuracy is sensitively dependent on the zero-point-energy parameter and the initial sampling strategy for the mapping variables.">

        <tr id="Consistency models (CMs) are an emerging class of generative models that offer faster sampling than traditional diffusion models. CMs enforce that all points along a sampling trajectory are mapped to the same initial point. But this target leads to resource-intensive training: for example, as of 2024, training a SoTA CM on CIFAR-10 takes one week on 8 GPUs. In this work, we propose an alternative scheme for training CMs, vastly improving the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs with a specific discretization. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pre-trained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly improved training times while indeed improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained of hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling law of CMs under ECT, showing that they seem to obey classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales.

        <tr id="Inverse problems describe the process of estimating the causal factors from a set of measurements or data. Mapping of often incomplete or degraded data to parameters is ill-posed, thus data-driven iterative solutions are required, for example when reconstructing clean images from poor signals. Diffusion models have shown promise as potent generative tools for solving inverse problems due to their superior reconstruction quality and their compatibility with iterative solvers. However, most existing approaches are limited to linear inverse problems represented as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). This simplification falls short of addressing the challenging nature of real-world problems, leading to amplified cumulative errors and biases. We provide an explanation for this gap through the lens of measure-preserving dynamics of Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) with which we analyse Temporal Distribution Discrepancy and thus introduce a theoretical framework based on RDS for SDE diffusion models. We uncover several strategies that inherently enhance the stability and generalizability of diffusion models for inverse problems and introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework, the \textbf{D}ynamics-aware S\textbf{D}E \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{M}odel (D$^3$GM). The \textit{Measure-preserving property} can return the degraded measurement to the original state despite complex degradation with the RDS concept of \textit{stability}. Our extensive experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of D$^3$GM across multiple benchmarks including a prominent application for inverse problems, magnetic resonance imaging. Code and data will be publicly available.">

        <tr id="This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper. For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner.">

Using a methodology based on concepts from information theory, we reveal that such optimised low-resolution representations are not only informative per se, but rather they also serve as probes of the neural network properties; these results show a tight and potentially fruitful relation between the level of detail at which the network is inspected and the type and amount of information that can be extracted from it.">

The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.">

        <tr id="We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.">

One prominent area of research is the utilization of deep learning techniques for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this work, we specifically focus on employing a three-layer tanh neural network within the framework of the deep Ritz method(DRM) to solve second-order elliptic equations with three different types of boundary conditions. We perform projected gradient descent(PDG) to train the three-layer network and we establish its global convergence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a comprehensive error analysis of using overparameterized networks to solve PDE problems, as our analysis simultaneously includes estimates for approximation error, generalization error, and optimization error. We present error bound in terms of the sample size $n$ and our work provides guidance on how to set the network depth, width, step size, and number of iterations for the projected gradient descent algorithm. Importantly, our assumptions in this work are classical and we do not require any additional assumptions on the solution of the equation. This ensures the broad applicability and generality of our results.">

As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.">

        <tr id="We introduce a novel generative model for the representation of joint probability distributions of a possibly large number of discrete random variables. The approach uses measure transport by randomized assignment flows on the statistical submanifold of factorizing distributions, which also enables to sample efficiently from the target distribution and to assess the likelihood of unseen data points. The embedding of the flow via the Segre map in the meta-simplex of all discrete joint distributions ensures that any target distribution can be represented in principle, whose complexity in practice only depends on the parametrization of the affinity function of the dynamical assignment flow system. Our model can be trained in a simulation-free manner without integration by conditional Riemannian flow matching, using the training data encoded as geodesics in closed-form with respect to the e-connection of information geometry. By projecting high-dimensional flow matching in the meta-simplex of joint distributions to the submanifold of factorizing distributions, our approach has strong motivation from first principles of modeling coupled discrete variables. Numerical experiments devoted to distributions of structured image labelings demonstrate the applicability to large-scale problems, which may include discrete distributions in other application areas. Performance measures show that our approach scales better with the increasing number of classes than recent related work.">

Recent world models predominantly operate on sequences of discrete latent variables to model environment dynamics. However, this compression into a compact discrete representation may ignore visual details that are important for reinforcement learning. Concurrently, diffusion models have become a dominant approach for image generation, challenging well-established methods modeling discrete latents. Motivated by this paradigm shift, we introduce DIAMOND (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams), a reinforcement learning agent trained in a diffusion world model. We analyze the key design choices that are required to make diffusion suitable for world modeling, and demonstrate how improved visual details can lead to improved agent performance. DIAMOND achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.46 on the competitive Atari 100k benchmark; a new best for agents trained entirely within a world model.

        <tr id="Diffusion models have emerged as effective distribution estimators in vision, language, and reinforcement learning, but their use as priors in downstream tasks poses an intractable posterior inference problem. This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.">

The first model is exact (un-approximated) and global, casting the neural network as an elements in a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS); we use this model to provide tight bounds on Rademacher complexity. The second model is exact and local, casting the change in neural network function resulting from a bounded change in weights and biases (ie. a training step) in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in terms of a local-intrinsic neural kernel (LiNK). This local model provides insight into model adaptation through tight bounds on Rademacher complexity of network adaptation. We also prove that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) is a first-order approximation of the LiNK kernel. Finally, and noting that the LiNK does not provide a representor theory for technical reasons, we present an exact novel representor theory for layer-wise neural network training with unregularized gradient descent in terms of a local-extrinsic neural kernel (LeNK). This representor theory gives insight into the role of higher-order statistics in neural network training and the effect of kernel evolution in neural-network kernel models.

        <tr id="The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established as an effective technique to produce interpretable models of dynamical systems from time-resolved state data via sparse regression. However, to model parameterized systems, SINDy requires data from transient trajectories for various parameter values over the range of interest, which are typically difficult to acquire experimentally. In this work, we extend SINDy to be able to leverage data on fixed points and/or limit cycles to reduce the number of transient trajectories needed for successful system identification. To achieve this, we incorporate the data on these attractors at various parameter values as constraints in the optimization problem. First, we show that enforcing these as hard constraints leads to an ill-conditioned regression problem due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we implement soft constraints by modifying the cost function to be minimized. This leads to the formulation of a multi-objective sparse regression problem where we simultaneously seek to minimize the error of the fit to the transients trajectories and to the data on attractors, while penalizing the number of terms in the model. Our extension, demonstrated on several numerical examples, is more robust to noisy measurements and requires substantially less training data than the original SINDy method to correctly identify a parameterized dynamical system.">

In this paper, we propose a novel accuracy-preserved tensor-train (APTT) method to efficiently solve the Boltzmann-BGK equation. A second-order finite difference scheme is applied to discretize the Boltzmann-BGK equation, resulting in a tensor algebraic system at each time step. Based on the low-rank TT representation, the tensor algebraic system is then approximated as a TT-based low-rank system, which is efficiently solved using the TT-modified alternating least-squares (TT-MALS) solver. Thanks to the low-rank TT representation, the APTT method can significantly reduce the computational and memory costs compared to traditional numerical methods. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the APTT method maintains the same convergence rate as that of the finite difference scheme. The convergence rate and efficiency of the APTT method are validated by several benchmark test cases.">

Originally designed for handling very long time series, the model’s performance remains unexplored when it comes to shorter time series that often describe real-world applications. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to assess both the efficacy and efficiency of the LSTCN model using 25 time series datasets and different prediction horizons. The numerical simulations have concluded that after performing hyper-parameter tuning, LSTCNs are as powerful as state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, such as the Long Short-term Memory and the Gated Recurrent Unit, in terms of forecasting error. However, in terms of training time, the LSTCN model largely outperforms the remaining recurrent neural networks, thus emerging as the winner in our study.">

        <tr id="We study the problem of non-convex optimization using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). SGLD is a natural and popular variation of stochastic gradient descent where at each step, appropriately scaled Gaussian noise is added. To our knowledge, the only strategy for showing global convergence of SGLD on the loss function is to show that SGLD can sample from a stationary distribution which assigns larger mass when the function is small (the Gibbs measure), and then to convert these guarantees to optimization results. We employ a new strategy to analyze the convergence of SGLD to global minima, based on Lyapunov potentials and optimization. We convert the same mild conditions from previous works on SGLD into geometric properties based on Lyapunov potentials. This adapts well to the case with a stochastic gradient oracle, which is natural for machine learning applications where one wants to minimize population loss but only has access to stochastic gradients via minibatch training samples. Here we provide 1) improved rates in the setting of previous works studying SGLD for optimization, 2) the first finite gradient complexity guarantee for SGLD where the function is Lipschitz and the Gibbs measure defined by the function satisfies a Poincar\'e Inequality, and 3) prove if continuous-time Langevin Dynamics succeeds for optimization, then discrete-time SGLD succeeds under mild regularity assumptions.">

        <tr id="The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic states in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of training, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.">

        <tr id="A key property of neural networks driving their success is their ability to learn features from data. Understanding feature learning from a theoretical viewpoint is an emerging field with many open questions. In this work we capture finite-width effects with a systematic theory of network kernels in deep non-linear neural networks. We show that the Bayesian prior of the network can be written in closed form as a superposition of Gaussian processes, whose kernels are distributed with a variance that depends inversely on the network width N . A large deviation approach, which is exact in the proportional limit for the number of data points $P = \alpha N \rightarrow \infty$, yields a pair of forward-backward equations for the maximum a posteriori kernels in all layers at once. We study their solutions perturbatively to demonstrate how the backward propagation across layers aligns kernels with the target. An alternative field-theoretic formulation shows that kernel adaptation of the Bayesian posterior at finite-width results from fluctuations in the prior: larger fluctuations correspond to a more flexible network prior and thus enable stronger adaptation to data. We thus find a bridge between the classical edge-of-chaos NNGP theory and feature learning, exposing an intricate interplay between criticality, response functions, and feature scale.">

Adaptive biased sampling methods, such as metadynamics, tackle this issue by perturbing the Hamiltonian of a system with a history-dependent bias potential, enhancing the exploration of the ensemble of configurations and estimating the corresponding free energy surface (FES). Nevertheless, efficiently assessing and systematically improving their convergence remains an open problem. Here, building on mean force integration (MFI), we develop and test a metric for estimating the convergence of FESs obtained by combining asynchronous, independent simulations subject to diverse biasing protocols, including static biases, different variants of metadynamics, and various combinations of static and history-dependent biases. The developed metric and the ability to combine independent simulations granted by MFI enable us to devise strategies to systematically improve the quality of FES estimates. We demonstrate our approach by computing FES and assessing the convergence of a range of systems of increasing complexity, including one- and two-dimensional analytical FESs, alanine dipeptide, a Lennard-Jones supersaturated vapor undergoing liquid droplet nucleation, and the model of a colloidal system crystallizing via a two-step mechanism. The methods presented here can be generally applied to biased simulations and are implemented in pyMFI, a publicly accessible, open-source Python library.">

        <tr id="Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity samples from complex distributions through an iterative refinement process. Despite the empirical success of diffusion models in motion planning and control, the model-free nature of these methods does not leverage readily available model information and limits their generalization to new scenarios beyond the training data (e.g., new robots with different dynamics). In this work, we introduce Model-Based Diffusion (MBD), an optimization approach using the diffusion process to solve trajectory optimization (TO) problems without data. The key idea is to explicitly compute the score function by leveraging the model information in TO problems, which is why we refer to our approach as model-based diffusion. Moreover, although MBD does not require external data, it can be naturally integrated with data of diverse qualities to steer the diffusion process. We also reveal that MBD has interesting connections to sampling-based optimization. Empirical evaluations show that MBD outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and sampling-based TO methods in challenging contact-rich tasks. Additionally, MBD's ability to integrate with data enhances its versatility and practical applicability, even with imperfect and infeasible data (e.g., partial-state demonstrations for high-dimensional humanoids), beyond the scope of standard diffusion models.">

Within our approach, the penalized PDE is approximated using the Deep BSDE framework proposed by \cite{weinan2017deep}, which leads us to coin the term"Deep Penalty Method (DPM)"to refer to our algorithm. We show that the error of the DPM can be bounded by the loss function and $O(\frac{1}{\lambda})+O(\lambda h) +O(\sqrt{h})$, where $h$ is the step size in time and $\lambda$ is the penalty parameter. This finding emphasizes the need for careful consideration when selecting the penalization parameter and suggests that the discretization error converges at a rate of order $\frac{1}{2}$. We validate the efficacy of the DPM through numerical tests conducted on a high-dimensional optimal stopping model in the area of American option pricing. The numerical tests confirm both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of our proposed algorithm.">

        <tr id="Single-cell time series data frequently display considerable variability across a cell population. The current gold standard for inferring parameter distributions across cell populations is the Global Two Stage (GTS) approach for nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models. However, this method is computationally intensive, as it makes repeated use of non-convex optimization that in turn requires numerical integration of the underlying system. Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

        <tr id="Mesoscale cortical dynamics consist of stereotyped patterns of recurring activity motifs, however the constraints and rules governing how these motifs assemble over time is not known. Here we propose a Continuous Time Markov Chain model that probabilistically describes the temporal sequence of activity motifs using Markov Elements derived using semi-binary non-negative matrix factorization. Although derived from a discovery sample, these can be applied to new recordings from new mice. Unwrapping the associated transition probability matrix creates a ‘Markovian neural barcode’ describing the probability of Markov element transitions as a compact and interpretable representation of neocortical dynamics. We show broad utility across a range of common mesoscale cortical imaging applications, ranging from time-locked events to pathological models. Moreover, it allows the discovery of new and emergent Markov Elements that unmask the flexibility of constraints governing cortical dynamics. The Markovian neural barcode provides a novel and powerful tool to characterize cortical function.">

These models are systems of matrix ODE's describing collective motions (swarming dynamics) of abstract particles (generalized oscillators) on spheres, homogeneous spaces and Lie groups. Such models have been extensively studied from the beginning of XXI century both in statistical physics and control theory. They provide a suitable framework for encoding maps between various manifolds and are capable of learning over spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, they can learn coupled actions of transformation groups (such as special orthogonal, unitary and Lorentz groups). Furthermore, we overview families of probability distributions that provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic modeling and inference in Geometric Deep Learning. We argue in favor of using statistical models which arise in different Kuramoto models in the continuum limit of particles. The most convenient families of probability distributions are those which are invariant with respect to actions of certain symmetry groups.">

        <tr id="With the increasing prevalence of probabilistic programming languages, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has become the mainstay of applied Bayesian inference. However HMC still struggles to sample from densities with multiscale geometry: a large step size is needed to efficiently explore low curvature regions while a small step size is needed to accurately explore high curvature regions. We introduce the delayed rejection generalized HMC (DR-G-HMC) sampler that overcomes this challenge by employing dynamic step size selection, inspired by differential equation solvers. In a single sampling iteration, DR-G-HMC sequentially makes proposals with geometrically decreasing step sizes if necessary. This simulates Hamiltonian dynamics with increasing fidelity that, in high curvature regions, generates proposals with a higher chance of acceptance. DR-G-HMC also makes generalized HMC competitive by decreasing the number of rejections which otherwise cause inefficient backtracking and prevents directed movement. We present experiments to demonstrate that DR-G-HMC (1) correctly samples from multiscale densities, (2) makes generalized HMC methods competitive with the state of the art No-U-Turn sampler, and (3) is robust to tuning parameters.">

        <tr id="The stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model considered here is a two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic differential equation with additive degenerate noise, whose first component, the only one observed, describes the membrane voltage evolution of a single neuron. Due to its low dimensionality, its analytical and numerical tractability, and its neuronal interpretation, it has been used as a case study to test the performance of different statistical methods in estimating the underlying model parameters. Existing methods, however, often require complete observations, non-degeneracy of the noise or a complex architecture (e.g., to estimate the transition density of the process,"recovering"the unobserved second component), and they may not (satisfactorily) estimate all model parameters simultaneously. Moreover, these studies lack real data applications for the stochastic FHN model. Here, we tackle all challenges (non-globally Lipschitz drift, non-explicit solution, lack of available transition density, degeneracy of the noise, and partial observations) via an intuitive and easy-to-implement sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation algorithm. The proposed method relies on a recent computationally efficient and structure-preserving numerical splitting scheme for synthetic data generation, and on summary statistics exploiting the structural properties of the process. We succeed in estimating all model parameters from simulated data and, more remarkably, real action potential data of rats. The presented novel real-data fit may broaden the scope and credibility of this classic and widely used neuronal model.">

The different networks are trained via different maximization schemes of the regularized evidence lower bound: (i) the idealized case with exact estimation of a multiple Gaussian integral from the reparametrization trick, (ii) a minibatch scheme using Monte Carlo sampling, commonly known as Bayes-by-Backprop, and (iii) a computationally cheaper algorithm named Minimal VI. The latter was recently introduced by leveraging the information obtained at the level of the mean-field limit. Laws of large numbers are already rigorously proven for the three schemes that admits the same asymptotic limit. By deriving CLT, this work shows that the idealized and Bayes-by-Backprop schemes have similar fluctuation behavior, that is different from the Minimal VI one. Numerical experiments then illustrate that the Minimal VI scheme is still more efficient, in spite of bigger variances, thanks to its important gain in computational complexity.">

First, we showcase the application of machine learning methods to categorize various interaction regimes within the subtle interplay of electrons and the dynamical lattice landscape. Second, we shed light on a nebulous region of electron dynamics identified by the machine learning approach and then attribute it to transient localization, where strong lattice vibrations result in a momentary Anderson prison for electronic wavepackets, which are later released by the evolution of the lattice. Overall, our research illuminates the spectrum of dynamics within the Fröhlich model, such as transient localization, which has been suggested as a pivotal factor contributing to the mysteries surrounding strange metals. Furthermore, this paves the way for utilizing time-dependent perspectives in machine learning techniques for designing materials with tailored electron–lattice properties.">

The starting motivation is to understand how the strong-correlation properties of power-law distributed processes affect the possibility of exploring the whole domain of a stochastic process (the real axis in most cases) when performing time-average numerical simulations and how this relates to the numerical evaluation of the autocorrelation function. We show that correlations decrease the heterogeneity of the maximum values. Specifically, through numerical simulations we observe that for strongly correlated variables whose probability distribution function decays like a power-law $1/x^\alpha$, the maximum distribution has a tail compatible with a $1/x^{\alpha+2}$ decay, while for i.i.d. variables we expect a $1/x^\alpha$ decay. As a consequence, we also show that the numerically estimated autocorrelation function converges to the theoretical prediction according to a factor that depends on the length of the simulated time-series $n$ according to a power-law: $1/n^{\alpha^\delta}$ with $\delta<1$, This accounts for a very slow convergence rate.">
